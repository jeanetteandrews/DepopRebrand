5,Jasiry,Improvements,"So far I like this app to get a couple bucks in my pockets. I think it's a great app and has a lot of potential to grow a lot more. I used to use another buy & sell app (not mentioning the name because I don't want to be on here promoting another app) but that other app has made me A LOT of money simply because that app made it so so easy for users to find my listings. I think Depop should me make a couple improvements when it comes to the listings. 1.Create a new feature where we can actually share our listings therefore i listings are getting views and are not forgotten in our feed. By us being able to share new listings are listing are going to be visible to others because it will go in the feed. The more we share the more are listings get views. So for example we we have a homepage and everytime our friends share a listing of their own items or other friends items it goes into our feed""homepage"" and walaaah! We are able to see new items and have a lot more potential sales. Also having a ""favorite"" option to add our favorite users would be great because that way we can always easily go back to their feed and see if they posted new things. I have a lot more feedback. Hopefully these ones are taken into consideration as I do believe that making the listings more visible would me great for the app.",False,2018-09-17 06:27:46,
4,shetrippymane,The future is bright,"There is a lot about this app that I like! The shipping process is very simple! Leaving buyers & sellers reviews is super easy! The percentage Depop earns is low so you get a larger portion of what you sell in comparison to similar apps. If you’re looking for unique items this is an app for you. Unique items are everywhere & not everything has to be name brand. I find beautiful items all the time that are stylish & aren’t name brand. The focus should be on esthetic & how you style an item. My absolute favorite part is the expression of creativity. Depop is a place where you can bring the creative vision you have for your shop alive! Everyone puts a lot of thought into bringing their vision alive! Each shop has its own vibe, & I think that’s so cool! My only complaint is that it is very hard to get ahold of anyone at Depop. If you ever have a pressing issue the process is really annoying & time consuming. Returns & exchanges should be easier. But above all else communication should definitely be improved! Whether it be through email, phone, or through the app there should be a point of contact. It means a lot to hear a voice on the other end of the phone, or knowing there’s a real person emailing you who is concerned & willing to help. In my opinion this app could use some work here & there but 90% of it is working & very user friendly! I can’t wait to see what this app will be like in a year or two.

5,berrybluekid,Good enough for me,"I’ve had Depop for a while now and I’ve enjoyed it a lot for the most part as a buyer (haven’t experienced selling yet). I thought I hated shopping for clothing before I found Depop. I guess I just hate leaving my cozy home and the general styles I see at the mall and whatnot, but while using Depop I’m able to shop from the comfort of my house and find a variety of cute options of clothing in much lesser time than I would at a physical store. It’s easy to use and I’ve found so many nice outfits that I adore, and most are vintage meaning it’s likely I never would have had the opportunity to purchase without Depop. Plus, buying second hand clothing is environment friendly :) One complaint I do have though is that the app exits me out after a certain amount a time, which can get a bit irritating because I lose where I’m browsing. I hope this gets fixed, or that an option to check our browsing history is made available. I’m also glad that the app doesn’t give annoying notifications, except when they’re necessary, like follower updates/pm messages/comments from other users etc. I’ve seen that a lot of people have other (less positive) things to say about it, but for a shopping app, I think it’s a lot better in comparison to others and that it’s done a great job for the most part.",True,2018-05-07 23:52:43,"{'id': 3315644, 'body': ""Hey there - thanks for the 5 stars and we're glad you're enjoying the app!

4,V33k11,"Great app, still has room to improve","I have been buying and selling through Depop for almost a year now. It’s very easy to use on both counts, and I’ve found some really unique pieces I love. I have very alternative taste in clothing, so I can’t generally find things in typical high street stores, but Depop always has stuff that’s perfect for me.
My main complaint is the massive influx in dropshipping. If Depop won’t ban it outright, they should create a separate section for it. It’s difficult to search for anything when the app is clogged up with hundreds of people selling the exact same cheap Chinese knockoffs, and annoying to see listings for something for $50 that you can buy from Wish or Aliexpress yourself for $5. It’s especially scummy that they never disclose that this is what they’re doing, and often explain the 4 to 6 week shipping time as the item being ‘made to order’, which implies that *they* are the one making it, not some Chinese sweatshop. That’s borderline scamming, and I think they should at least be required to make it clear when they’re dropshipping. The misusing of tags also needs to be fixed, because as is, it’s almost impossible to find a specific brand when sellers flood the tags with unrelated items. Finally, I wish they’d ditch the fuzzy searching - for example, searching the keyword ‘clown’ will also return results for ‘crown’, etc.",False,2019-07-26 04:33:33,"{'id': 9893390, 'body': ""Hey there!

5,swagpotate,"awesome, but","I love this app! It’s so much more aesthetically pleasing and simplistic compared to other apps, and it’s super easy to get a hang of! The app itself is great in function, but it can be really difficult to find good stuff since a lot of people find a $3 toddler shirt thrifting and then sell it for $47 as a “rare baby tee”. It’s also REALLY common for people to put the brand as Brandy Melville just for exposure when it’s actually something from H&M. The app tried to discourage from doing this, but everyone does it anyway. However, you can still find a gem at a great price every once in a while. I have a suggestion that would make the app easier to use- while there are filters on the app to easily find what you’re looking for, I think it would make it even easier if there was a “sort by” option- ex. newest to oldest, lowest to highest price. This would be especially helpful for the “saved” section. I also think it would be great if you could automatically see which items you liked are already sold, similar to how you can see the word “sold” on top of items that you’ve saved. There are a few things that aren’t perfect, but overall, this app that’s structured almost like social media makes buying and selling secondhand clothing really easy and fun!",False,2020-07-09 03:22:01,"{'id': 16518411, 'body': ""Hey.

3,miaaaaaaa456,Great finds,"I used to use depop to both sell and buy but I found it quite hard to sell even trendier items at the most affordable prices. But something is up with Depops featured/explore page. It’s ALWAYS the same sellers and even items that were sold a week ago that are still being featured. That’s frustrating for both sellers looking to be noticed, and buyers looking for good items. I hate when I click on something from the featured page thinking “oh this is cute” only to find that it was sold 6 days ago — why is it still even there?? It’s also frustrating to be scrolling down that page and you see... the same of everything. 90% striped clothing. Two days later, 90% blue things. Few days later the explore page is 90% belts, or some other random accessory. Does that happen to anybody else or am I crazy? I hate it. 

That being said, I have found some great stuff as a buyer. Some of my favorite items in my wardrobe are from depop and I love the sellers that go the extra mile to create a good transaction. I believe depop recently began giving buyers a tailored page “just for you” and your individual interests. Is this supposed to be based on your personal searches? Because at this moment, my “just for you” page is mainly comprised of dad sneakers... which I have never searched or clicked on once during my entire time on depop. I’ve shown 0 interest in them ... so why are they all I’m seeing?",False,2019-04-08 05:21:13,"{'id': 8170612, 'body': 'Hi Mia, thank you for sending us some great feedback.

2,Fiona Soup,Nice App but has a Lot of Bugs,"I love this app for selling clothes. It’s an easy way to make your items accessible to the public as well as find quality items to purchase. I spend lots of time on this app buying and selling because it makes buying clothes sustainably and second hand more easy! That being said, I have a lot of issues with this app because of the innumerable amount of bugs it has. To name a few, it does not recognize when you have looked at your notifications and therefore the red alert on the iphone will not go away, and if an account is disabled or deleted, you can’t unlike the posts from that account and therefore they will remain in your liked posts forever. There are many other bugs that are a pain to deal with on a daily basis. A few other issues with this app are that there are many sellers on here that are rude, try to scam you, or overcharge for simple items - but that isn’t really Depop’s fault. Depop takes about 10% of your earnings each time you make a sale which definitely adds up over time so if you’re planning on selling a lot of clothes and/or having a larger business, then Depop is not the place to start your shop. But if you have a very small business and sell just your old clothes then Depop is a great place to do that! I prefer Depop to other selling apps such as Poshmark and Ebay immensely! I only hope that Depop can fix a lot of the bugs that currently exist on the app.",False,2020-12-07 08:39:45,"{'id': 19697840, 'body': ""Hey, we can imagine how frustrating this is and we’re currently working to resolve this issue.

5,Lefting4,Best Buying/Selling App Ever,"I started using Depop around 4 months ago, because I was really into vintage clothing at the time and was looking to find some nice deals. I was so used to using eBay and other apps, but I was very excited to find an app dedicated to mainly clothes only. I found some awesome stuff, and was buying avidly on Depop. I just loved the way the app was set up and just everything about it. The format and everything. It was awesome. Then, one day I decided to try to sell some stuff. I wanted to give it a shot to see if I could get some extra cash. I started off my selling my old clothes. It took a couple weeks of likes on items and messages until I finally had my first sale. It was very exciting for me and I thought I was the coolest person ever that at the age of 14 I sold an item. But my business took off after that sale. It then became a habit of myself and my brother who also has a Depop shop, going to thrift stores every weekend to find cool vintage pieces to re sell on our Depop accounts. Since my first sale, I’ve made about 60+ more sales, and have great feedback from all customers. I’ve made a bunch of money, and I just can’t believe I’m doing this as a 14 year old. It’s truly a great way to become a young entrepreneur. 5 stars.",False,2018-05-24 12:36:37,
4,Rainysky17,Well I'm happy with it,"I see a lot of mixed reviews here that I've taken the time to read. I think people are expecting a lot from this app, which is very good; though demanding all of the kinks and tweaks to be made ASAP I don't necessarily agree with. In my opinion the app does what it is supposed to. I'm seeing a lot of complaints about the explorer page but come on. Okay yes, I get that it helps sell items but is it really that big of a deal? So the same, relatively well known sellers get a spot more frequently than the rest of us but that's just something that needs to be worked out. And, if you asked me, doesn't take away from the functionality of the app. To me, the app is lovely and I spend a lot of time paroozing through clothes just to pass time. I know the app has a couple of things that need a bit of TLC but I'm going to stick by the app and support it because I think it's a great concept. All apps have things that they need to work out, I mean come on.. that new snapchat update?... Instagram's chronological issue that they haven't changed bc they won't acknowledge that we all loath is? No. That is not this app. This app, as I have seen, listens to the critique of its users.

2,Kielondsey,Users take advantage of you,"I started using this app a few months ago and all was good until I bought from a user that deleted their account before shipping their item. Depop does offer customer service however, they provided little to no help in getting my money back. Instead told me that their was a dispute with the user’s account and to wait for my money to possibly and/or item to come, both which never did. I was also sent a link by Depop to handle the dispute with PayPal even though I didn’t pay using PayPal. It seems that accounts like these that take advantage of people don’t get any serious action or consequences. Issues like these can be handled better and Depop can at the very least notify those who purchased items from an account that’s having issues or give those a refund for their product. It makes me wary to use this app to buy anything knowing this could easily happen again.

Edit: PayPal did not pull up any transaction history used through the Depop app. Which is why I state I did not use PayPal to pay for my item. This creates an issue when reporting a problem to PayPal due to there being no history. There’s little options for those that have made an in-app purchase due to lack of history. Instead, the only option seems to be go through the same process of filling out a description of your dispute, which was the same process being used by Depop to handle the situation.",True,2018-03-27 03:09:21,"{'id': 2913195, 'body': ""Hey there!

4,Turtles714,I need help!,"So I really loved this app but would never really get any shells but I thought I would keep selling in there anyway. Then I accidentally logged out of it and when I tried to log back in it wouldn’t let me. Sooo I thought okay maybe I need to reset my password so I reset it from my email and then tried again  and it still wouldn’t let me:( so then I looked it up and it said to try and delete the app and download it again and so that’s what I did.

UPDATE:!!!! I am back in!!!!! I looked it up for more research and I found some info! So it said to try and turn your phone off and back on to see if it works and then if it doesn’t then turn off your WiFi and try again( that’s when mine worked— when I turned off my WiFi— ) and then if it doesn’t work when you turn off your WiFi, you can email depop about it!

3,RaeUhh,Suggestions,"The idea of this app is smart and could save people lots of money and help clear out closets; however, I am a little wary of the depop protection after what I recently experienced. I bought an item that never was shipped to me and made sure to wait a decent amount of time after contacting the seller (approximately a month) before contacting depop about it. When I contacted depop they said they would contact the seller and if they did not respond in a few days I should make a claim/start a dispute through PayPal. After a few days and no response, I went to make a dispute; however, I realized that PayPal never sent me a receipt so I did not have a transaction number nor proof through the PayPal app that I made this purchase. Although, looking at my bank account, it was clear that money was taken out of my account through depop. I then called PayPal customer service and was on hold for almost an hour waiting to talk to a real person. The lady on the phone was very nice and helped me get my money back; however, I do think this process could have been a lot easier if depop took it in their hands instead of making their customers figure it out. I also would suggest having a “cancel order” option (like Poshmark) to cancel an order that was never shipped and get money back an easier way.",False,2018-10-10 20:35:32,"{'id': 5472129, 'body': ""Hi there, thank you so much for your feedback.

There have been a few changes done to Depop throughout my year of use and some have been very necessary including Depop payments! But even Depop payments is in its early stages of development and has a lot of work to be done. What Depop really needs is an update focused on the sellers, and making their jobs easier since they are the ones keeping it alive!

1,natzzzm,Depop is a freaking MESS. Poshmark or Mercari is way better,"I’ve been on depop for 6 years so I’ve seen a ton of things go down.

Customer service has been nothing but blunt to me and always walk around my questions. my account recently got hacked and it’s been 2 and half weeks and I STILL CANT GET IN. I’ve emailed them countless times and they keep saying they email me a password reset that I never receive...

I’m surprised they don’t have a phone number to call so things can move along quicker... yet I see them posting on all these social media accounts. Yeah after 6 years I’ve had enough this app is just a joke now. When you search anything you get all these scams that pop up or people trying to drop ship from China. They use to have a worldwide button where you could only search worldwide and took it away, which is super inconvenient as some brands aren’t worldwide so I have to scroll for 5 minutes straight just to get to the worldwide section...which imo is going backwards?!

1,Gracedendy,Buyer Beware,"I have been using both Poshmark and Depop and have come to conclude that Depop is unsafe for Buyers. One you have experienced an unreliable Seller, it is so difficult to get a refund. The app claims that you should try to work it out with the Seller, but if the issue is that the Seller is unresponsive, have accepted the Buyer’s money through Paypal, then what is the point of making the Buyer contact the Seller to resolve a dispute. Poshmark allows the Buyer to withhold payment for the item until it is delivered and tendered in the specified condition advertised by he Seller on the app. It is safer for a Buyer to go through Poshmark simply because in failed transactions between Seller and Buyer, Poshmark is well invested in ensuring that both parties act and perform as promised. When claiming that an item has not been delivered, Depop send you standard response e-mails telling Buyer to try to contact the Seller through the app as well as Paypal. They provide no help and have no authority in taking appropriate measures to keep their community safe and free from scam. Selling and Buying online is a risky thing to do. Once you have contracted to sell or buy, you subject your identity as well as your address and location to the opposite party. Operating without any authority makes Depop a dangerous way to make simple purchases online.

I was able to start selling in 2019 and it was really easy and I got quite a lot of sales in 2019 and overall enjoyed the app. For the past few months in 2020 Depop has literally gone SO DOWNHILL. To start, they barely had any brands from the get go and it’s really hard to try and put brands for items when they don’t even have a category for it on the brand section. And all the updates constantly make me hate the app so much more. The fees are also ridiculous as well, I sold 2 items for $25 and only got $7..?????? They take a huge percentage and even when the money goes to your PayPal, PayPal takes money off too. The newest update is what makes me hate depop the most. They have it so it’s automatically on free shipping and you have to manually change it EVERY time you want to post. It gets annoying and sometimes I forget and end up only getting $4-$5 off of a shirt I sold for $16 because they take fees AND since it’s “free shipping” they pay for the label.

3,litttlejackson,Room for improvement,"I've been using depop for over 2 years now and have just a few suggestions to make it better (in my opinion)
1. The option to cancel/refund a buyer immediately through the app. It's virtually impossible to refund someone without losing money as a seller, since payments are sent directly to PayPal where a fee is taken out (my next suggestion for improvement) sellers will always be out a few bucks for refunding someone due to PayPal feels. Like depops competitors Mercari and Poshmark they have easy ways to cancel orders and refund buyers.
2. There should be a way to receive payments through PayPal to avoid fees. I don't want to raise my prices to accommodate the fees because I always raise my price 10% to accommodate depop fees. 
3. Very often shipping on my items switches from USPS (which I chose) to arranging my own shipping (which I do NOT want). I have had this issue several times and I am then at a loss bc shipping within the app is much cheaper and efficient. When it glitches and people buy my items with this shipping chosen I then have to pay more for shipping and visit my local post office which is difficult due to their specific hours and the fact that I'm a full time student and work a full time job.",False,2017-09-28 17:24:32,
2,sarah51780,Help the baby shops too!,"I love selling and buying on this app. It’s so cool to see what everyone is selling and it’s awesome to make some extra cash by cleaning out your closet. 
However, I agree with some of the other reviews. The explore page is full of the same people. Big shops are automatically featured several times a day on the explore page. My shop has been running for more than a year, and i have sold many items, but I’ve only been featured once. It’s hard to catch up to those guys when Depop is putting the spotlight on the same people. Also, the 10% fee that Depop takes is understandable, but also makes it a bit hard to actually make some money. I liked the week where Depop only took 5% and I wish they’d do that permanently. 
This app is perfect for buying vintage items, but difficult to sell unless you’re in the 1%.

UPDATE: the new update has a “staff picks” section of the explore that picks their favorite shops... all of which are shops that have skinny people modeling small clothes. A friend of mine that is currently on that page even got an email that told her to keep up with modeling her clothes and it had a bunch of “what not to do”’s. Unfortunately, I cannot model most of my clothes because I have outgrown them, so I suppose I’ll never be featured on explore. :/",False,2018-01-19 22:27:34,

This caused me to use other methods for payment means. I only made two transactions with other Depop accounts (who were also dealing with the same PayPal issue). Less than a few weeks pass and Depop suspends my account indefinitely. The emails I received explained that there had sent me many warnings which they did not and when I tried to explain this they defended themselves and said that their decision would not change. This has happened to many Depop stores. I had read under their one of Depop’s twitter page posts that a girl’s store was suspended for bullying when one of her buyers called her a racial slur. She provided screenshots as evidence and they never gave her account back. Depop needs to open up the payment options and allow users to dispute suspensions if the seller has proof and Depop should HONOR it. PayPal is a very buggy website and does not work for everyone. Instead of punishing the stores that are honest and true they should focus on better means for transactions, policies, and dispute customer service needs.",False,2020-07-07 19:46:53,"{'id': 16515566, 'body': ""Hey, we’re sorry to hear your experience hasn't gone to plan.

Some people aren’t as nice but that rarely happens. On the other hand lately I’ve noticed people have been contacting me regarding how they try and purchase something from my shop and it comes up as an error. This issue is not just happening to me. I tried contacting Depop about it but they have not gotten back to me. I also contacted them them the same day reporting someone who was not being very nice and they got back to me in 24 hours about that incident but not about my PROBLEM that involves my customers. Considering this is my only income at the moment this is a very big problem that’s going on. I would also like to point out how their only payment option is PayPal. I’ve had so many problems with PayPal it’s insane. If they could have another payment option that would be so helpful. Going through you’re bank card or even Venmo.

5,Kristy T.,SELLERS BEWARE!! HORRIBLE SELLER PROTECTION!!,I started using depop and really liked it to start. Like many other selling apps such as Mercari and Poshmark they offer shipping labels through their discounted shipping program set up with SHIPPO but UNLIKE other apps they don’t provide any help whatsoever when a shipment goes missing and you cannot file a claim on their shipping account. I lost $30 on an item that was lost because they refused to file a claim or do anything to help. On top of this I had to refund the customer (no problem when protected) $30 so one item cost me $60 in losses due to their crappy customer service and absolutely clueless seller support. I do not recommend this app to sellers who expect any seller protections because they are nonexistent!! I used this apps labels in good faith that they would provide the necessary help if an item got lost but they DID NOTHING to help beyond calling me a liar over and over. It’s a shame because the app has promise as an app but as a company they are beyond unbusinesslike and I cannot send a warning loud enough to sellers who are used to feeling safe selling to NOT TO USE THIS APP!!,False,2018-08-24 15:28:04,"{'id': 4841058, 'body': ""Hey Kristy - sorry to read you're not happy with Depop.

5,Liltothelay,Great,"The app overall is wonderful! especially for those just trying to get rid of clothes they don’t wear anymore, but for those trying to build a brand / business, it’s a little difficult. I’ve been using the app for months now and this is MY PERSONAL case. 
I eventually want to start my own brand so months ago I found the app to be a great platform to do so. They used to feature such a variety of people. Now they don’t so much, I don’t want to say they pick favorites, but it’s the same people time and time again being featured. I have been lucky to be featured a handful of time, but every time I do my feature is always at the bottom bottom and I feel like that puts me at a disadvantage. Sometimes I can’t even find myself on the explore page even though I’m featured. 
The percentage they take is REALLY FAIR considering all the other apps I’ve tried using, take an outrageous percentage, so you definitely can make some cash.

After a long search I found some I found a seller who I was able to make a good deal with. I made the purchase through PayPal so I could be covered by the protection policy. After a long and tedious process with the shipment (where I was forced to pay extra because they were being held at customs) I finally received my shoes and they were nothing like what I was paying for. First and foremost they were a COUNTERFIT!!! I was in shock I immediately got in touch with the seller but he denied that they were a counterfeit and pretended like he did not understand what the problem was. He said he was just reselling the shoes and that the came from a store that was legit. Even if I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and believe that he did not know they were counterfeit he still did not sell me the shoes as he advertised them. He had assured me that the shoes would come in a size 11 in the original shoebox, and with the receipt. I didn’t get any of those things. He just threw them in a plastic bag and shipped them off. And they weren’t even in my size?!

Initially, I fell in love with the app bc of the aesthetic and how much time and effort some people put into taking nice pictures. But I decided to start selling, bc being a college student, I definitely need the extra money. Well, I'll keep it nice and short. THEY TAKE MONEY FROM YOUR ACCOUNT RANDOMLY WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. I got an email saying $8 was taken from my account randomly!! Not even part of the percentage they take from you after a sale, it was just so random! If you email them for help they WILL NOT answer!!!! Also, they need a ""retweet"" button to get your listings out there again, instead of going to edit and posting your listing again, Whenever i use poshmark they answer their emails in less than 24 hours and always help!! Never a problem on there. Depop is probably the most confusing app I've ever used. They should stop using Paypal, and use bank accounts instead, and focus on the customers rather than the whole aesthetic. There are TOO many fees (depop fee, paypal fee, and just random money they decided to take out) Anyways, I will continue to buy on there, ONLY bc they have good finds! But be very careful!!

5,fromsanfrancisco,THIS IS A BUYER REVIEW NOT SELLER,"My style is constantly evolving and this app is the best for that. It's v easy to find cheap, CUTE AND HIGH QUALITY CLOTHES/VINTAGE. Every seller I've dealt with on this app is super sweet and generally pretty fast! A lot of negative comments seem to be from sellers feeling this site is unfair with the way they charge an extra fee to seller and don't seem versatile with explore page. Buyer negative comments are mostly people who don't seem to understand how busy some of these sellers are or don't message the seller asking about a product before buying which definitely isn't too smart.  I feel like you have to check someone's profile out before buying just to ensure if they are active/have good reviews which is not hard to do. also make sure you check the quality of the photos and that they have multiple of one piece, because sometimes things can look different online than in person .

This isn’t really isn’t about my experience because I was lucky enough to have a good experience with depop so far. I convinced my bf and sister to get depop to let go some of their items & make cash. However both of them experienced not receiving shipping labels EVEN WHEN THEIR PAYPALS ARE VERIFIED. And I’m sorry depop but your support team needs a lot of work. For my bf it took two weeks to get the shipping label for ONE out of TWO items people bought from him. My sister is STILL WAITING for them to get back to her. My bf deleted his old depop account to try and see if it’ll work on his new account and the SAME THING HAPPENED. Plus the support team sent the same advice to verify your account to my bf when he had already made it clear that it was already verified and he couldn’t get the label. He ended up paying out of pocket for shipping for one of the items because he wasn’t able to access the shipping label. Now that the same incident is happening again to my bf it is stressing him out because he might have to go through this process all over again. He’s going to check one more time to see if his account is verified for sure.

1,kullumasl,UNPROFESSIONAL - failure to own up to mistakes,"I don’t know what is up with their engineering and PR team, but Depop has been experiencing so many glitches and does not handle them appropriately, citing user blame or another company to blame (Paypal) in response to criticisms by Depop buyers and sellers. Recently, they had a huge glitch obviously caused by a problem with the newly implemented Depop shipping methods, causing Depop seller accounts to be automatically suspended despite following community guidelines. 

Depop has barely responded to any of the instagram comments or tweets about this and failed to make any kind of announcement regarding their plans of action. Once a few accounts finally got unsuspended, they were sent an email recommending that they verify their Paypal account and link their bank accounts to PayPal. HOWEVER, users stated they used DEPOP PAYMENTS, NOT PAYPAL. So Depop basically blamed the user for a problem that was obviously their company’s. 

For some people, Depop is their only income and for the company to disregard how this app is inherently serious since it deals with money and any glitch would be a huge issue for sellers depending on Depop? it’s sickening.

Depop has no customer service (you can’t even call or email a real person) and doesn’t deal with refunds in app. If you don’t receive an item or a seller ghosts you after payment, you have to go to PayPal and file a dispute yourself in order to get your money back.

I bought an item over a month ago and I’ve been trying to get in contact with the seller or get a refund for weeks and it is taking FOREVER to get my money back ($150+).

1,z33girl,Total Waste of Time and Money,"I have a lot of problems with this app and the way it is run...
Firstly, I have ordered so many items on Depop that just never came. I gave it a chance multiple times, and I have wasted a good amount of money buying accessories and stickers that never arrived at my door. Since Depop customer service wasn’t at all helpful with this, the store owners had to just give me store credit. The problem is that I didn’t end up using that store credit because I didn’t want anything else; I wanted the items I had ordered. So essentially I never got my money back for the packages that never came. This has happened so many times that I am done purchasing anything on this app, not wanting to spend money on something I’ll never get. It really makes it look like a scam, the fact that this kept happening. 
Secondly, customer service is pretty awful. NEWS FLASH DEPOP - deleting and reinstalling the app is not a universal fix for all problems. You need to look into your consumers complaints and problems and figure out how to fix them, instead of giving a half assed assessment of what could have caused the problem.

2,BeachJournalist,"Fun, But Has Issues","DePop is a fun site, resembling Instagram in the formatting and use of emojis. But there are major issues that need to be addressed before I purchase items on here again: My biggest complaint is that sellers get paid immediately and then have SEVEN DAYS to ship your item before you can ask for a refund because they never shipped it. Another site I use - Mercari - only gives a three day shipping window and the money doesn’t transfer into the seller’s account until the buyer confirms the purchase has been delivered. This gives the seller an incentive to make sure their stuff gets delivered. There are accounts on DePop that haven’t been visited by their sellers in months yet the items are still for sale and the site is still collecting payments! Not cool. Also, there is no way to determine whether or not the seller is offering free shipping, nor can you see prices on the thumbnail pictures when you’re scrolling through shopping. Mercari has a ‘free shipping’ icon and pricing visible on all the thumbnails, and you can also save your search parameters for later.

However, the next day I noticed the users account was deleted by paypal and they mentioned that he violated some terms. Thankfully, I followed my gut and knew to reach out to pay pal. I disputed my case to a claim right away because I wasn’t going to wait another 30 days for this seller to reach out to me (they never did).

3,kwissuu,"App Problems, It’s Okay","Depop is overall a decent app for selling clothing, it has a lot of really helpful features and makes the shipping process fairly smooth. However recently there’s been a LOT of bugs, including app freezing/crashing, slow loading screens, items not showing up in tags, and jumping when scrolling (clicking to look at an item and then backspacing during a search will send you back to the top of the list.) There’s also a lot of things they aren’t exactly transparent about that you might want to be aware of before you start selling there, like the fact that they take a 10% fee off of anything you sell, and they take all of whatever shipping cost you add if you ship through them, which is already often higher than shipping outside of Depop and not an option for international shipping. Plus, of course, the ridiculous amount of scammers, people who sell for way overpriced amounts, drop-shippers who fly under the radar, and inactive sellers that aren’t properly marked as inactive, etc., but that’s a common theme with any app like this, you just need to be careful!",False,2020-05-13 02:00:34,"{'id': 15300614, 'body': ""Hey, we can imagine how frustrating this is.

1,punkchimera,such a scam,"I’ve been using Depop for several months now, and most of my experiences have been very good! However, working with their support team is awful. They patronize you and ignore your emails, and the two major issues I’ve had have been with giant accounts that Depop doesn’t seem to regulate at all. Depop’s system seems to punish the small accounts and reward the large ones. They do this in their explore page, where they’ll just feature the same big accounts over and over again (I’ve never once been chosen for it, due to the small size of my account), and in their feedback system, where I was punished for leaving a 2-star review (which was not rude in any way) because it was going to damage the reputation of a big account with over 4 times as many followers as me.
Not to mention, Depop also keeps a record of everything you’ve ever posted (even if it’s deleted) and they look through your private messages. This app is pretty amazing but the people who run it make me sick.

EDIT: they also have practically no recourse for scammers, an item I purchased in 2017 was never shipped and they did absolutely nothing to help. They wouldn't even contact the scammer. I’m literally done with this app catch me on Mercari",False,2018-01-21 18:01:37,

Then I got Depop, and it was great! The clothes are affordable because they are resold, I usually don’t have to worry about my item showing up and not looking like the image, because the sellers are people just like me, and not some big company. Also there’s such a large variety and amount of sellers that I can usually find what I want. The only problem I think is that there are not a lot of plus size clothes, although that’s not exactly the app’s fault, I guess there are just less sellers in that part of sizing. Overall though I really like the app, it’s affordable, easy, not sketchy, and the layout is really simple (it’s similar to Instagram). I’ve recommended this app to a few people cuz I really like it.

2,sundayforstars,It's alright.,"It's, for the most part, simple to use. If you take clear photos and interact with people, you should get sales. I love how some people let you swap with them. It makes it feel less risky that you can trade clothing you're unable to try on instead of spend money on  it. I agree with other negative reviewers that the featured page is frustrating. I have no idea how some people get on there with 5-word descriptions and one picture, and how some people can be on there 5 times at once. 

My biggest issue is the app itself. I feel like more than 50% of the time I have to contact customer service because there's a technical issue. The option to leave feedback is there for some transactions but not for others. I also wouldn't recommend choosing the option for Depop to make your shipping label because if someone has a change of address, you can't edit the label once its made. It takes multiple steps and days to fix it and get a refund. It's better to choose your own shipping and go thru PayPal or the post office.

I appreciate that their customer service has been quick up to this point, it's just an extra hassle.",False,2017-11-04 17:20:34,

But I contacted PayPal and they completely verified my account and I still got the error message. When I contacted Depop support and reported the issue, they told me it was still PayPal. I’ve tried EVERYTHING. I deleted and redownloaded and signed in and out of both apps on my phone, waited a few days, contacted support for both companies (and have been in a back and forth in an endless cycle of replies that are getting me nowhere) and for Depop it takes them up to like 5 days to respond! I sold my item almost 2 weeks ago and I still can’t view the shipping label or receive payment!

When I first started I had to make a new account because the shipping labels wouldn’t form.

Literally every 10 seconds, I’ve written emails to depop and have they gotten back? Nope. I’ve written reported about other sellers to depop and they’ve gotten back to those so it’s like I guess I’m being ghosted by customer service??? I have to sit down and delete the app and then redownload it EVERYDAY just to get rid of that problem. I sell a lot of stuff everyday so it’s very irritating.

If you don’t have sufficient funds, they keep charging/overdrafting your account!!! Didn’t know that til, I got hit with 2 return check fees!! FYI, since Depop goes a third party (Paypal) they have their own rules of receiving your money and if you’re a new customer and make a pricy sale over $200 they hold your funds until the buyer receives their product! So here I am, negative in my account on top of still haven’t gotten paid for the sale because the tracking stop updating! Needless to say that will be my first and last sale I make with Depop! Oh and if you have any payment issues and not receiving a product from a seller they can’t help you...you have to go through paypal for your refund!!! So they are basically USELESS!

As someone ordering to a college campus with 17 individual on campus residence buildings and only 1 mail room, it will be literally impossible to receive my packages without my any of my building information and only a street address. I reached out to customer service, and the solution they suggested to reformat my address didn’t work at all.

My only complaint is that when you search for an item on depop the results are littered with random, unrelated listings just because some sellers (usually smaller ones) add random words or tags into the caption in hopes of getting more views on their listing. This makes it really frustrating to try to search for a specific item or to get one of the items I am selling to pop up on the appropriate tags. I hope depop finds a way to fix this. 

Also, the should create an iPad friendly version of the app. DEPOP SHOULD ALSO FEATURE A LARGER VARIETY OF ACCOUNTS ON THE EXPLORE PAGE. It’s always the same few depop famous people when there are soooo many smaller sellers that post great quality photos and could use the help and exposure of the explore page.

Everything was very simple straight forward. Lately the updates just keep getting worse and worse. They are trying to do too much and it’s deeply affecting sellers and buyers. SELLERS ur items will not be seen anymore BUYERS u will not see the cute stuff ur favorite sellers post anymore. MY DNA and the EXPLORE feature is causing this issue of lack of sales and engagement.

My first- and only- time using this app was a complete disaster (but was not at the hand of the developers— just a poor seller). I purchased an item that the seller had “lost” and after asking the seller through direct message for a refund, the seller vanished and I lost my money to them. 
I would recommend creating a paypal account instead of using “PayPal guest”, as PayPal is the only accepted in-app form of payment. If a situation arises when you would need to settle a dispute over an item you did not receive, you cannot conveniently move forward without a PayPal account.

Suddenly everything is so expensive. Sellers are either selling things they bought from sites like AliExpress of Shein way over priced. Or there are others that sell their thrift store finds for $50 when they got it for less than $10. Also there are a huge number of sellers posting Brandy Melville items for hundreds of dollars, when they aren’t even worth $50. This app has gone downhill, thanks to capitalism and the rich. This was supposed to be an app to find/buy affordable unique clothing. Lastly when you search for a specific item or brand, it doesn’t pop up immediately because people have tagged their items to get exposure. Depop should set a limit for how to price certain items.

(for instance! a size L tee shirt described as fitting sizes XS to L depending on desired fit and then being marked as an XS size) this is VERY common and feeds into a feeling of everyone on the app being incredibly thin and creates borderline body dismorphia. this also can make it harder for people who wear larger sizes to find clothes that fit them bc nothing is marked correctly if they search by size. i find this to be repulsive behavior by the sellers. just something to be aware of.",True,2020-10-25 20:13:27,"{'id': 17653240, 'body': ""Hey.

3,ChameleonGal,dont get me wrong,"Don't get me wrong I love this app. It is a very simple interface making it easy to navigate. But i hate the explore feed feature. It's the same clothes everyday and it barely caters to my likes and saves. It's ALWAYS things I've already liked, things that are already sold, but mostly clothes I just don't like and have been purposefully ignoring only for it to be there for the next few days. (maybe a dislike button or something would help there😅) For example the majority of my likes are modern streetwear yet all the clothes I really see are vintage sweaters and pants. I'm assuming it's due to people using the wrong tags/key words for exposure, but it's still annoying having to look at the same clothes I don't like every day. Which brings me to my next issue.

Original review: 

I enjoyed this app for the first year or so that I used it. I was able to get good deals on items that I couldn’t find anywhere else. Now, it seems like Depop has lost all care and protection for its buyers. 2 packages in the last 3 weeks have been lost, and Depop doesn’t care to help me get my money back. I’ve reached out several times. I would be cautious buying from this app, because even though it says you’re protected by PayPal, you aren’t. You have to dispute all issues with the seller. Sellers lie about the condition of items, and then you’re stuck with a piece of junk you can’t get a refund or return on. There is no protection for buyers.

3,elisesamo,YOU ARE NOT PROTECTED BY BUYERS PROTECTION!!,"First and last time I order here. I bought a bag on here and it never got to me I called USPS emailed them, talked to depop, and talked to buyer never got anything back. No bag or money so I just lost money and never got anything and depop won’t do anything about it I’m really disappointed and scared to buy from here now because I don’t feel protected. They told me they can’t do anything about it so I didn’t get any of my money back so take your chances buying on here.

Also guys just go ahead and look at all the most recent reviews, do you see how many are one star ? if you get this app and never get your items or app shuts off every second you’ll see why you should’ve have gotten this app

-DONT even try to tell me to look at your buyers protection I read the whole thing and it literally tells me that depop will give me a refund if I don’t receive my item, WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN so take your response somewhere else or update your buyers protection, or give me my money back for something I did not get.",True,2020-09-12 01:42:13,"{'id': 17825681, 'body': ""\nHey, we’re sorry to hear your experience hasn't gone to plan.

I'm new to Depop...I'm loving the simple platform and wide array of items in the feeds. I love how easy it is to snap a pic and list it. I love the fact that they offer video product listings...no other marketplace I'm on does that and it's incredible! The only thing I would like added or refined is the desktop platform. I noticed that it's basically a page that shows the feeds...I'm unable to edit my profile or list anything via the main website. I'd like to have this option to avoid using up my phone storage due to all the pics I take. I for one, like to offer more than 4 photos of items to give buyers every possible angle...especially when it comes to clothing. 

I'd really love to use my camera and shoot at will. This way I can easily crop photos and work on listings on a larger screen. Please consider. Thank you so much!

2,gintrashbin,Drop shippers are ruining the app,"I’ve been using depop for a couple years and I’ve found and sold some great items but it’s getting increasingly difficult to find pieces due to the redundant tags that many people use. In order to get exposure, people flood with tags. Because of the excessive tags, people don’t get exposure. It just makes the buyers’ experience more difficult. The most upsetting is the recent influx of “drop shippers,” or people who purchase items online from stores like AliExpress or Wish and send them from the supplier to their buyer on depop making 200% profit on a $3 item. Not only does it make buying/selling that much harder but it discourages the sustainable lifestyle that I originally downloaded depop for. I’m disappointed that drop shippers are not only allowed but encouraged and placed on the explore page. As a buyer, I wouldn’t download this app now because finding the right item is incredibly difficult and frustrating. As a seller, I wouldn’t download this app now because selling an item is almost impossible when put against drop shippers and flooded with tags.",False,2019-06-16 12:26:20,"{'id': 9284061, 'body': 'Hi there, thanks for this feedback.

I have one simple suggestion, which has been bothering me enough that I really felt the need to make a review in hopes of it being seen. It would be very helpful if there was a feature that allowed users to scroll continuously down, and instead of receiving suggestions, it goes in order of the posts. Now that may sound confusing, but let me give an example. 
I wish I had the ability to go to my “Saved” items page, click on the first item which I have saved, and when I scroll down the next post is the next item I have saved. It would make it so much easier to view all the items I have in one place, and allow me to more quickly edit said posts.",False,2019-07-14 14:15:54,"{'id': 9669488, 'body': ""Hey there!

4,Cantina123,iPad,"I am scaling up my selling on Depop and it’s become too much to handle just using my phone. My thumb is exhausted. Unfortunately the desktop version of the app is just too limited to be efficient. I decided that the best solution is to use an iPad because it’s a bigger screen, easier to edit photos, easier to organize files etc. The Depop Apple app description says it supports the app on iPads. But I was super disappointed to find out that meant it is exactly the interface of the iPhone version just disproportionally enlarged/stretched out, clunky, and vertical-only. I remember when the iPad first came out like 10 years ago, that’s what a lot of apps did to say that they have an “iPad version.” They just translate exactly what is on the iPhone, just obnoxiously stretched out. Developing for different devices has come a loooong way since then so I’m bummed that Depop hasn’t got with it yet.

All they care about is verified sellers. I sell handmade earrings and I built my small business from nothing and worked so hard for it, then I came across a seller who bought a a pair of my earrings (and received an additional pair for free) and is reselling my hard work. First thing I did was email Depop will all proofs of her receipt, our messages from her purchase, my original posts, and her replica posts. So I made a post to warn my customers to not buy from her because she’s profiting off my hard work and then Depop deletes my post. Her fraudulent activity clearly violates rule #2, but they don’t care because they say “it’s ok to resell items” As if she bought those earrings from Walmart or Clair’s, she DIDNT  because I MADE THEM!

I feel like I have great quality listings however the search algorithm really doesn’t appear to cater to newer users. The “famous” front page  Depop users seem to be at the forefront of each style you want to shop which does not allow much exposure for newer members wishing to sell unless you’re selling name brand hypebeast type clothing. 

This dynamic leads to a bunch of random followings which takes you down a rabbit hole of other users who seem to be having the same problem desperately trying to increase their follower account so their clothes can get featured.

4,Haven Alexandria,Almost There,"I love depop once I finally found people to follow. It took a while but I got there. I’ve already made 5 purchases and am IN LOVE. 

I have a few suggestions though:
1) Featured Page: It’s unclear wether the featured page is curated to items the app thinks I’ll like or if they are trending items on the app.
2) Sold Items: My BIGGEST pet peeve is how items don’t have a sold banner across them in people’s “likes” or the featured page. Nothing is more frustrated than clicking on an item only to find out it’s sold. I think the sold banners should not be exclusive to people’s stores. This brings me back to the featured page... why are sold items still listed there? I’m not too interested in using this app as a style reference as much as I am using it as a serious customer. I don’t want to see items that are sold on the featured page unless that have a banner tagging them as such.
3) I think some sort of saved search and notification feature would be really useful since there are certain things I am looking for and I wouldn’t have to manually enter the same things every couple of days.
4) Like I mentioned at first, it took me a bit to get into this app. Unlike other apps, it doesn’t help you find people to follow.

1,CCasey_A,You can be scammed,"When I first used Depop, I was very happy to find a platform where I could find good clothes. However, I soon figured out that many Depop users were not reliable. It is very easy to get scanned on Depop. In my experience, the Depop user led me to believe that they had sent the package but in reality they hadn’t. I had no way of reporting them because the Depop user had told me to use PayPal instead of doing this through the app. I followed their instructions, but I was scammed. I couldn’t report this account because there was no way of reporting accounts that you didn’t have a “receipt” from. Even if i could’ve reported the account, the account could no longer be found because I suspect that the user had deleted their account. I know that this was partly user error but there are still things that Depop should improve. There should be a way to report any account and they should be some way to trace back the user.

Another experience I bought another item in which the seller immediately blocked me. This feature is app breaking as I have no way to communicate to the person I just did business with; this is ridiculous.

I have had such good experiences up until now. But not because of depop. Because of the sellers I’ve worked with. Depop offers buyer protection through PayPal. What does that mean? I’m not sure, because the description of buyer protection is not what they offer whatsoever. It’s a pit against the seller & the buyer. I had EVIDENCE that I never received my item & they still sided with the seller because I didn’t want to open a police report against the seller. Which is some crap honestly. If I never received my order, shouldn’t “BUYER protection” mean I am covered? Well you would think so, but that wasn’t the case. They also deleted the review I left for the seller because IT WASN’T FAIR!!! Are you kidding me? It was completely fair! Get your priorities straight.

3,ifucanthangbby,"Great finds, some features need fixing","I enjoy this app for its great finds and ease of swapping. However, there are many issues that have caused me to use depop less. 1) If a seller uses depop labels and they never ship, there is no way to leave a review as the status will remain “awaiting shipping.” As a buyer, this has happened many times, and I would find it helpful to see how many times a seller does not carry through on their end. 2) Sometimes it will not let me leave feedback EVER. Super confusing glitch here. 3) It would be very helpful if there was a way to hold/deactivate my whole closet in one go. As a uni student who lives in two different places, everytime I go on break, I have to mark every item as sold. It’s very time consuming. 4) The search feature is the worst! Every time I search anything these shops come up just because they put a bunch of irrelevant tags in their descriptions.

1,Tatl Teal,Don’t use- a total scam. Takes unapproved charged from your PayPal!,"I started using a few months ago both as a buyer and seller, and have noticed at least half a dozen unapproved withdrawals on my PayPal account from “depop limited” usually around $6 but going over 20$ as well. These happen on days I have no activity on depop whatsoever!!! I have no received any response from costumer support although I’ve waited weeks and sent multiple messages! I still have pending transactions on PayPal for items that have been delivered weeks ago, and some payments that say received I didn’t receive in my bank account at all. Still no response or accountably from depop whatsoever!!! These withdrawals are not the 10% listing fee like I’ve seen them respond to other reviews!!! I have no items that these transactions would be 10% of and like I said, they happen on days where there are no activity whatsoever!

Unfortunately though my account (Grimebunny) has been suspended and I’m not totally sure why! I have over 250+ 5 star reviews and have made SO many amazing pals through this app. The fact I can’t log is is totally breaking my heart right now.

Like hear me out- when someone posts a product, in the description, there should be a # for what it ACTUALLY is and then another hashtag section where they add other things that are related to their product. In that way, other people can find their account just as much as people finding what they’re ACTUALLY looking for.

Dropshipping in itself is not a violation, however, a majority of them mislead buyers by using stock images and lie about their shop location. With delivery times of up to 50 days, it is obvious that items are shipped directly from cheap manufacturers and sweat shops in countries like China. This not only a scam but it also violates Depop’s ‘Rules of Acceptable Use’. As a brand that supports ‘entrepreneurial’ sellers and promotes sustainability living through campaigns such as ‘#nothingnew’, it is really disappointing to see Depop respond to reports of accounts like these with copy/pasted responses and to be in support of user’s that not only mislead customers, but also promotes fast fashion and the terrible working conditions of sweat shops.

4,Yay this is great fun ya,great but always needs improvement,"I love depop for buying and selling second hand things. I like buying more basics and well know brands on the cheaper side. This makes it pretty easy to find those without hassle. 
One thing that i’ve noticed is that when you want to know the shipping amount on a item to find out you have to put that item in the cart and then check your cart. if you leave that item in your cart then you will get a notification that it’s still there along with an email. There should be a quicker way to check like something in the corner or just a little +____ next to the price. 
Secondly can you fix the notification problem. The notifications just never go away for me so when i see them im wondering maybe it’s a new message or something and it’s not. This is a really minor detail but i like not having notifications.

4,Sunshinegirlkr,Love it- but needs more features,"UPDATED: I love all the new features Depop has been working on. Thank you! A few features I’d still like to see: 
-rearranging items in the app: maybe similar to the way iPhone icons can be arranged- press and hold.
-sending photos through private messages so potential customers can see more images of the items
-be able to add more than 4 photos to a post
-let customers post photos in their reviews!! 

I’ve been on Depop for 4 months now and love it! When I was consistently posting 4-5 items a day, I was getting featured on the explore page daily. If you’re active and post nice photos, you will be featured! I love the clean and simple layout of the app. The newly added features like search filters are amazing and this app is definitely improving. I would really like to have the same features that the computer site has, though. For example: “Move all sold items down” and “Rearrange”. Sending photos in messages would be a plus, because sometimes customers ask for a photo of a specific part of an item and with only 4 photos allowed, it’s difficult to do this. Which brings me to: let us add more than 4 photos of an item! We want to show all views and flaws of items and 4 photos is just not enough to do it. 6-8 would be best.

4,nicole.crispino1,Require Buyers to Review!!,"There needs to be a way for Depop to require buyers to review their purchases!! Mercari and Poshmark have found ways to require buyers to review the purchase within 3 days after the product has been delivered and then the sale is closed or completed regardless of if they left a review or not! I wish Depop would do the same. I have made so many more sales than I have received reviews, which means these sales have technically never been completed, even if the buyer messages me that they received and loved the item (they just didn’t leave a review). It’s annoying to us and the buyer to have to hassle buyers to leave a review on the purchase, so I usually don’t and am left with an uncompleted sale! There has to be a way to change this!!

Mercari makes sure that customers don’t get scammed and buyers have to ship in 3 business days which is fair. Sellers on Depop are allowed to take more time then that, it took a seller 1 1/2 weeks to ship an item. Also, I recently got scammed by a seller. She blocked me after I purchased something and it turns out she did the same to a few other people. I have to personally file the claim with Paypal.

While some sellers have been great to work with, the communication with other sellers is sometimes non existent. Knowing whether orders have been shipped or not isn’t super obvious unless the seller updates you. You also have to be careful when placing an order to make sure if the seller is still active.

1,Sps supporter,Awful customer service,"My first time making a purchase on Depop, I made sure to follow Depop guidance to only pay in-app and communicate with the seller in the app. I paid via Apple Pay in the app but then never received the item and the seller stopped responding after I paid. I spent over a month emailing with Depop customer service to try to get a refund. While they kept reassuring me my payment was protected bc I paid through the app, they kept pushing me to dispute the issue with PayPal. PayPal has no record of my transaction bc I didn’t pay through PayPal. I had to explain this several times in talking to Depop customer service personnel which seemed to change even though I was responding to the same email chain. Nearly two months later, I’ve decided the amount of time and energy it’s taken to try to resolve this is not worth it. I’m never using this app again. If you successfully purchase something on this app, you’re probably fine.

1,geleraC,Overall Bad,"Downloaded the app to see if I could find any graphic tees or local sellers, only to find that the majority of the items sold on Depop are sold at RETAIL PRICE. Not all styles are catered to as well, you’re only going to be able to find vintage clothing as well as certain “trendy” aesthetics such as Y2K or E-girl/boy. Seriously not advisable to shop here for much else. If you dress casually, you won’t find much that will be worth the asking price. If you’re wondering, I usually shop at vans or Tilly’s, I found many vans tees being sold for more than the retail price. 

I would highly suggest that you check out your local thrift shops, garage sales, or even other buy and sell apps, far too many people on here that think it is acceptable to sell used items for retail price. If you’re looking for something very specific this might be a place for you, if you’re just looking to buy clothes to add to your closet, definitely not a good place to look. Likely the worst buy and sell community I have ever explored. Deleted the app after a day of using.",False,2020-08-13 23:24:11,"{'id': 17298856, 'body': ""Hey. Thanks for the feedback.

1,Daniel Moran,Done,"I like the concept of the app, but it’s poorly designed. I bought an item and the seller put in that they would be using depop’s label for shipping. well they didn’t, which is fine. except the notification never went away because in depop’s eyes the item never shipped. i contacted support (which is a joke - for every problem they just tell you to delete and reinstall the app) and they said there was NOTHING they could do and the notification would reset in 90 days. 20 weeks later, yes over 140 days, the notification is still there. contacted “support” and what do they tell me? delete and reinstall the app. so i do it (again) giving them some benefit of the doubt. before i even open the app and actually log in there’s a red notification sitting on it. logged in, looked through my notifications and it won’t go away. also depop only highlights the same “depop famous” people so the “explore” tab isn’t really exploring once you look at it once. i like the concept of the app but not enough to deal with how poorly it works.",False,2017-12-28 13:08:39,

5,ValerieLauren214,A wonderful selling space,"I’ve been a member of Depop since May of last year. I joined as a seller and it has been a completely new selling experience all it’s own. Unlike other platforms, Depop lets you get personal about your personal style. They have a simple 10% sellers fee that’s taken at the point of sale, and not billed to you at the end of the month like most other platforms. I prefer it this way, no end of the month surprises and they also don’t charge you to post items which is a major life saver for those running a small business. All those extra fees can really add up. Aside from this Depop also cares about their community, constantly reaching out to help you grow as a seller and them grow as a platform.

I love the ease of the app and its features, but there are some improvements that would make it infinitely better - 1)The option to show 5+ photos as 4 is just not enough to show the item off fully. 2)The option to send photos directly to potential buyers via private message. 3)More shipping size options - as there’s an 8-lb different between the small and medium package sizes and that doesn’t work for my package most of the time. Somewhere in between would be very helpful. **4)The option to edit photos in the app, such as how zoomed in/out the displayed photo is. In order to edit one, I have to delete it and then re-post. It’s very time consuming and seems like an easy fix. The last two are the most important to me. Overall, I love the app, but some changes are needed.",False,2018-06-25 16:15:37,

However, this one thing bothers me. In settings, under My Account, there’s a section where you can put your sizes in tops, bottoms, and shoes. I’ve yet to see what this does! I thought it was to filter the items that appear under “Made For You” but nope! I still get clothes and shoes that are too small or too big. I think if it actually did anything it would be a handy little tool, especially since Made For You is where I look the most for clothes, since the suggestions come from the things I have liked.

Though I have had issues where, depop’s service fee is a 10% cut, but they will start to take a little more and more of your profits the more you sell. I sold something for  $4.30 and they charged me $3:60!!! Obviously The amount is so low that it didn’t put me in debt, but SERIOUSLY?!? This is like the fourth time they’ve taken wayyyyy more than they said they would. Depop’s charges are automatic, so I can get a refund. They are so hard to get in contact with if you have a problem too. Honestly this used to be my favorite app I’m I’m just kind of upset. Little things have piled up over time.

3,paulathehutt,Depop,"I think the fees are a real killer when you get taken money not only from depop but from PayPal too.

I’ve messed up typing them before but once you hit ok, you can’t go back to edit. I see that feedback is hard to find for newcomers so I don’t get one when a purchase is complete, either a notification or a better explanation of where they can be done would be great. I think a seller should have to give feedback first before a buyer, a lot of sellers wait to see what the feedback they get is and if it’s bad then they also give a bad review or don’t give one at all.

I use other apps like Poshmark, and Curtsy but this one not only charges a low and fair cost for shipping (with no added fees that skyrocket the price of your item) but it also seems to have the best prices of things in the first place (maybe because it doesn’t take a portion of whatever the person sells it for?

When I contacted their customer service multiple times, I was met with the same copy and pasted emails, saying that I would continue to be banned.

1,ccoretaa,Rethink this app,"At first I thought this app was cool but the more I used its features the more frustrated I became. 
The depop shipping is hard to use in my opinion. I feel like they charge so much when in reality if I just went to USPS and had them weigh it, it would cost the buyer less. 
Depop also takes 10% of your earnings, not including the shipping so if you as the seller pay for the shipping, they take that out and then the depop fee, then whatever’s left gets transferred to PayPal and they even take a cut. When everything is said and done I feel like I barely scrape by. I’ve tried marking up my items to then receive what I feel is just but then my items don’t move fast or at all. 
I think depop takes too high of a percentage. For example, etsy takes 5% and charges 20 cents per listing, way better deal. 
Not sure about posh mark or other used clothing specific apps but I’ll be figuring out an alternative.
I recently had to refund a buyer that bundled and got free shipping, I emailed depop all the info to receive a refund on the depop fee and the shipping.

The first being that no matter how I set up shipping as a seller, I somehow always pay for something to be shipped out. Even if the customer is meant to pay it. I’ve found that adding the shipping price to the amount I want to sell the item for works best. It took a few tries but I got it figured out. The only other problem I have is that depop uses paypal and nothing else. My paypal is entirely setup, yet I have multiple transactions from selling that are pending or have been cancelled. Personally, I feel depop should also allow venmo as a payment option. It’s easier and much faster.

Posting items for sale takes minimal effort.  Getting discovered is simple- just use hashtags to show up in searches.  The shipment can be calculated for you, directly through USPS, and the shipping label is emailed to the seller immediately after an item is purchased, which is super convenient.  It’s nice to be able to watch buyer trends.  You are also provided selling and photography tips, which I found to be very helpful and you really get the opportunity to have your shop highlighted, through the explore page!

In summary, beware that: if you have *any* problem while using depop, they basically don’t have customer service. You can try as you might to email, Facebook message, Instagram message, etc. but they will either not respond for a week, send you copy pasted instructions that aren’t helpful, or just not respond to you at all. I have had multiple legitimate problems with the app and it has been a nightmare simply trying to get a response about them. And then to top it off my boyfriend bought a $20 hat from this guy who just never shipped it, and when he contacted depop go report it, guess what? No response. So I guess we just got scammed out of $20???

One thing I especially like is that you pay your selling fees straight away whereas on a certain other ‘auction’ site you pay them every 4-6 weeks and get a huge bill-paying the few each time avoids that unpleasant surprise.

I have actually used this app since the first time it came out and I been a seller the whole time and bought a few things. I’m complaining because it seems like there is more hackers and depop does not do anything to help you if you are seller getting scammed. For some reason, a customer was able to purchase an item and it said “pay through paypal.” I checked my account and there was nothing pending or on hold. I got no notification from paypal and I usually do after depop sends a notification someone had bought. I already contacted paypal and depop to see what may be the problem.

Other than that I like this app and think it is a good way to find unique clothes and make a little cash.

Pros: 
Very personal friendly environment 
Beautiful photography

Recommendations:
1: Caters to very small people, please! add more clothing size options. Women’s pants sizes should go up to at least 20 or 22 not 12. You have a large plus size community but it’s hard to find anything without the correct search filters. 
2: Frequent glitches, every few weeks there seems to be a new glitch. Sometimes messages stop working for a few days, right now I’m not getting any notifications. Please fix this. It’s not a new app. 
3: We should be able to re arrange our shop! A drag and drop editing screen would take care of this. 
4: Vacation Mode! If a seller is gone they have to make an announcement but it someone doesn’t see it and buys they might get angry about how long they have to wait. 
5: Store wide discount. An option to add a temporary discount to every item in your store would be nice. 
6: More chances to get on the explore page, it would be cool to have a weekly theme or something and a hashtag people could put on their listings that fit that theme for a chance to get featured.

I’m even noticing a bit of traffic towards my page, whereas on Etsy, I’d tried my hardest for around a month to make a sell and had been unsuccessful with little to no engagement, and they ended up suspending my account for being under 18 which I can understand but the rules and steps to recover it were ridiculous.

I reached out to team depop and I had to explain it about 5 times in the SAME email chain (they couldn’t have gone back to read the previous emails?) and I got NO help. On top of that, one of the responses from them was pretty passive aggressive. Just horrendous.

Also, I miss being able to mark messages as unread! That was really useful for me, who also works 2 full-time jobs over the summer and is a full-time student in the other seasons.

I’ve been on the explore page multiple times: its not just big Depop shops, you just need high-quality photos and TAGS! Its also important to update your items so they appear higher in a search.

However I think the app should develop guidelines for how to grow shops/get exposures, and it should DEFINITELY develop a way for users to reorganize their store page without updating individual items. 

As a shopper, it can be really hard to find an item if you know what you want. So while its great for browsing, you can only apply one filter and one search term at a time.

1,Mars7000,"ZERO protection for buyers that receive damaged items, and tons of fakes","Warning: Let me tell you why you should never use Depop. 
You buy a dress. It arrives damaged and not as described. With Poshmark, Mercari, Vinted, Tradesy, Curtsy, hell even EBay, all you do is click the not as described button. Fill out the description and attach a photo. A couple days later, you have a return label sent to you. Easy. 
Depop? It says all buyers are protected. Oh great! Nope. Click on the area to report a transaction, and it says that they do zero to help, won’t even get involved, and you need to file a claim with PayPal. Which means you PAY to ship this broken item back. Depop says, “sorry not our problem!!”

 I bought a dress. It arrived, and she lied about the size. Not only that, but the zipper is broken. I know have a dress that doesn’t fit, and it is broken. 
Depop will NOT help you . I tried to open a case and it just says that they don’t get involved, and you need to open a case with PayPal. 
Again. Poshmark, Mercari, etc. protect you. Get a damaged item and they handle it all. Not Depop! 
Also, most of the anime items are fakes, yet you can’t report the item, you have to report the seller and list what the item is. Then it doesn’t get taken down.

Some room for improvement to increase sales in my opinion:
1. Offer more brands when categorizing listings. Not many brands are in the app as opposed to Poshmark & Mercari
2. Allow more than 4 pictures per listing. It would allow for more transparency when advising customers of any signs of wear on items 
3. Add a “make an offer button” that binds your offer to your payment method for 24 hours, seller would have the option to accept, counter or decline. It would prove to be a faster way to barter than messaging.

March 27, 2017: Same sellers being featured on the explore page, giving less exposure to other shops who don’t have a huge follower count. Explore page & “staff picks” shows favoritism toward slim people I rarely see people of color, plus size, or older people there, which is strange considering that it’s an international app. No way to make on offer with the press of a button like Mercari or Poshmark. If you arrange your own shipping as a seller, Depop takes their commission out of your own money, unlike other reselling apps.

2,TheHeather12,No improvements on this app,"I started selling on this app a year ago. I have been apart of the depop Facebook community as well and everyone agrees that they need to do more updating on this app. We are only allowed to upload 4 photos!!!! When you’re an online seller you cannot work with JUST 4 PHOTOS! Everyone has been asking for this for a long time now and nothing has been done about it. I hate doing this and leaving bad reviews but when it’s been over a year of people complaining about this app and not working to help their sellers and buyers, it’s extremely frustrating! 
Every selling app has changed their platforms to make it easier and BETTER for the sellers and buyers. I feel as if our emails never go through or they just read their emails and never respond.  There’s apps out there that have updated and why can’t depop do the same thing? I would like to see change ASAP!",False,2020-06-02 19:45:54,"{'id': 15777791, 'body': ""Hey. Thanks for the feedback.

Every person I've bought an item from is extremely reliable, understanding, and always willing to make a deal. I love the fact that most shops let you ""bundle"" so that you can get discounts off of multiple items you'd like to purchase from them. The only thing that would make this app even better would be a post notifications feature, because sometimes it's disappointing to see that I've missed a shops items by a day or two (or maybe even just a few hours) because I wasn't checking the app every minute.

3,Pandacorntribe,Some negatives as a buyer and seller,"Depop app does this dumb thing where it changes shipping to “my own shipping” even though I had the Ship with USPS option checked. Which I’ve had a problem with more than once and then have to find out after someone has already purchased an item and go through the whole process of making my own shipping label and trying to find a good price.

It also cancels the app out when I go deep enough into the explore page.

And although, it’s not entirely the apps problem I’ve had problems with lying sellers and buyers.
People that think adding “vintage” to something excuses all the defects with the item without showing or mentioning it in the description. And they just simply add “no returns, not my problem after I ship” to there bio like that changes anything.

Also if you’re a buyer you have to watch out for petty sellers that give you a low rating because you’re honest with them and their inconsistency and immorality. And Depop rarely does anything about bad sellers/buyers even if you have proof.

The good thing is you can get your money right away, but I guess that can be somewhat bad too if there are smart scammers lurking about.

Also it’s fun to see the creativity, passion and efforts sellers put into their pages and items.",False,2019-01-13 00:18:31,"{'id': 6885726, 'body': ""Hi there, we appreciate your feedback so much!

My number 1 issue is that there has been a glitch for MONTHS that doesn’t allow you to leave feedback for random people. I had two really bad issues with sellers that I would like to let other people know about but Depop still has not fixed this since JUNE! Also, I can’t reward the good sellers with good feedback.

1,Naaaaaaattttt,Use at your own risk,"I downloaded depop and my items didn’t sell for a while. My app crashed and could not locate it anywhere on my phone (did not delete it and my App Store said i still had it downloaded). I gave up and later on was notified my items would be deleted. Cool. Then I apparently started selling items. I could not use the app because of the said “glitch”. Not my problem. But that created many problems for me that I was basically forced to deal with on my own, seeing as their customer service is hardly helpful and not too friendly or easy to work with. I had a specific question I couldn’t get figured out on my own so I emailed them and got back copy and pasted mass answer from sections of their FAQ. Which you can obviously find out for yourself.

The shipping fees are weird and hard to work with because of how separated they are from paypal so it isn’t user friendly by any means. And somehow I feel like I lost money out of the deal.",False,2017-12-07 06:57:40,
1,lynette1104,GARBAGE!!!,This app is literally horrible for selling.  I sold two items and delivered them on here over month ago and my funds are on “hold”. They told me to wait 21 days for my funds to be released but it’s been over 21 days and I have received nothing not only that depop has tried to take 20$ from my account out of no where and whenever I send an email about why I am being charged they don’t respond or it’s some stupid automated message that doesn’t answer my question there is no call number or anything only an email that I get no response from.  I’ve used other sites like Poshmark and the process was SOOO much easier and I was paid for the merchandise and  for depop to be much more popular I would have expected so much more but the whole process of selling with this website was so stressful and I most definetly would never recommend it.

It would also be really neat to eventually see an option to show the product via gif or video format or some sort of 3D way to get as close to seeing the product in real life as possible. I would love to see more features as well, such as monthly reports, daily engagement such as views, clicks, revenue, things like that to help better understand just exactly how sellers are doing.

3,livybooboo99,It’s okay.,"I am trying Depop and so far it has been such a headache! Setting up PayPal is really difficult and confusing. Depop takes fees from you when you make a sale. However I wasn’t under the impression that these fees would be taken from me BEFORE I received payment for the sale yet they did. I have not received any payment from my sale yet and they took $18 out of my personal bank account. So I made a sale, got no money from the sale yet, and am out $18 until the person receives their item. How does that make sense. I wasn’t expecting that and now I can’t pay bills because of it. I looked it up and it says if your PayPal is empty then they will take it from your bank account. Still don’t understand why they would take their fees before I even get my money from MY sale. But okay.",False,2020-12-18 16:37:37,
1,pixelfaerie,Terrible Customer Service and Algorithm,"As other fellow Depop sellers have voiced out, Depop’s recent algorithm update has dramatically decrease sales and traffic for many sellers, including myself. The community has been frequently voicing their constructive criticism regarding this, just to receive standoffish and redundant responses that elude the actual problem. At this rate, I’ve been strongly been considering to switching to Etsy. 

Sellers pay for fees, out their sale transactions, to support changes to benefit the community yet I have yet to see that implemented. The updates have been incredibly useful, if not counterproductive. Not to mention, it’s always been quite hard to contact customer support, which is ridiculous. Other selling apps, such as Mercari and Poshmark, it’s easier to contact customer service.

But lately I have become increasingly frustrated by the fact that the same high-volume sellers (with already massive follower bases) seem to appear more and more frequently on the explore page. I didn’t mind when it was 1-2 items at a time but it’s pretty disheartening to see that these users continue to gain followers when there are so many other smaller shops that don’t get recognized. When I started using Depop I appreciated the fact that “little people” like myself seemed to have a fair chance at starting a small business and gaining a following. But I’ve seriously begun to question whether or not that’s still a realistic possibility.

I used this app to purchase & buy.  A seller by the name Y2VINTAGE never sent me an item that cost me $45.  I got it as a gift for my brother, I had to show up empty handed at his party.

USPS raised their prices in January and Depop raised their prices around that time (although it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when as they seem to have removed all info about prior price increases, hmmm...).  Depop uses Shippo to generate the labels and on Shippo’s own blog you can see a price chart showing that Depop is now overcharging for their shipping labels, ESPECIALLY for lighter packages, which I’m sure comprise the majority of Depop sales.  Is Depop overcharging for shipping labels so they can pocket the difference?  Sure seems like it.  You’re better off using flat rate envelopes or PayPal’s shipping for most things now, although Depop tries to strong-arm you into using their shipping by taking 10% of what the customer pays you for shipping if you choose to arrange your own shipping.

I’ve sold around 15 items and I’ve been selling for maybe 2 months. They make it so easy to buy and sell. I also bought an item that was lost by the post office and I was able to get a refund from the post office. Everyone I’ve spoke with has been extremely kind as well as the depop customer support people. If you are hesitating selling your items like I was just do it. Incredibly easy process! The fees are a little annoying but my clothes would be sitting on the floor of my closet unused so it’s worth it.,False,2018-03-22 21:36:35,"{'id': 2913264, 'body': 'Thanks for leaving this review!

1,Xxxrfsdt,One star because it’s easy to sell,"But other than that it’s horrible. They have bad customer service and only care about making money. There are many dropshippers in the app but they don’t do anything about while I’m just trying to sell clothing but my listings get removed for supposedly breaking the rules, which I admit I used to use 5 tags that are not related to my item but then there’s always people who post 80 spam tags and their listings don’t get removed. Many times I’ve thought of quitting because they don’t care but I need money. Also the 10% fee isn’t going anywhere because there’s still many bugs in the app and when I make a listing I can’t see the pictures that I used, they’re all blank. Most importantly, with the 10% fee the least you could do is get better customer service, take pirateship for example they are such sweethearts.

4,qtkt<3,PLEASE FIX BUGS<3,"(from an iPhone) I love this app a lot and I think its so great and easy. But recently theres been problems with holding filter settings on my search page. Also, every time I am going through my searched and click on an item, it sends me all the way to the top of the list, which at first didn't bother me, but the farther I go down the more of a hassle it is to find where I was to begin with. 

I also suggest bringing back the scrolling option on searches. I think a lot of us would be happy if we were able to scroll through listed items one by one in a continuous feed but also view things in grid view (kinda like instagram's user profiles). 

Another thing I suggest (sorry if I'm going on) is being able to send posts in the pm's rather than through other apps. Me and my friends all have Depop and constantly send stuff to each other, but I feel like its annoying to have to exit Depop, open messages, only to be redirected to the Depop post.

2,Icecreamjudgement,"Cool idea, many problems.","I've used this site many times with successful purchases, but I have two problems with this app that keep me from being able to raise the rating over a 2 stars. There's no good way of telling the quality of the item in a photo. I received many shirts with a layer of white fuzz over the top of the fabric or severely faded colors. 
Second, I've made two purchases and the seller never contacted me back. That would be no problem if the buyer protection was in tact. But it's not. I've contacted the site many times and reported the items I haven't received with no response at all from depop in the year I've been attempting contact. 
All in all, I enjoy this site, and its idea, but it doesn't have enough rules and regulations and I've ended up disappointed as much as satisfied. Please be wary of using this app so you don't lose as much money as I did.",False,2018-06-24 22:35:56,

3,okaylauren,Good idea poorly executed,"This app is such a great way to buy sell clothes that are no longer worn and I really do enjoy using it but there are many MANY cons to it. A few examples.

Cons :

Follow limit. Like honestly. Some people follow 500k+ and then you put the limit on us to 7501? That decreases not as popular sellers ability to have our account seen or find new people to follow it. My biggest pet peeve about the whole app.

Constant crashes. Whether it’s opening someone’s shop or even after you purchase an item. The app is ALWAYS crashing. You don’t know if your purchase completed or not because it crashed halfway through or you lost someone’s account you were looking at. So many bugs.

Depop goes through faces of only putting certain accounts on the explore page. There will be 5 items from the same big seller rather than a small account that really needs the publicity.

10% is taken from what you sell. I really use this app as an extra source of income whether it’s to pay for my dog food for the week or buy my lunch it’s really helpful to have a little extra but when you sell something for 100$ you really get 90$ it doesn’t seem like much but it’s a definite annoyance. At least have like 8%.",False,2017-10-23 01:44:52,
2,norahnew,Small business owner screwed by depop.,"Hello fellow Depop seller here. I was emailed and notified that 1/4th of my entire stock shop listings were removed due to “term infringement” (inaccurate keywords?) and that I can’t repost at risk of being banned. As I was not aware of this and it was a large portion of my product inventory I would like the option to have my posts reinstated so that I may edit the items captions or that I may have permission to repost the items since they are simply my clothing pieces. It seems unfair to not give sellers a warning before removing products for sale. Typically I have had great experiences with the platform but I am appalled by how this situation has been handled.

4,Kimmargoo,Well,I guess since this is an app where regular people send stuff that they have lying around their house and not everyone is 100 percent honest with what they’re selling or sending there are a few precautions that you as a buyer should take. In my case my first purchase was 2 hair products and I only received one and “bait and switch” for the second one . Which is a bit disappointing but since it wasn’t a large investment I’m not that pressed on the matter. The seller is still getting docked stars by me on that and I’m not putting every seller on the same level as this one. I’ll try purchasing again and see if it happens again.

3,Class of 2015 :),Could be Great if Not for The Drop-Shippers,"As a vintage and second-hand enthusiast, I really love the concept of Depop. Their Earth Day promotions, in addition to their platform against fast-fashion, really drew me to use the app to buy and sell used clothing. 

Recently, customer service has confirmed that Depop is now allowing drop-shipping, which, in my opinion, has the potential to ruin the app for buyers. A lot of sellers are marketing cheap fast fashion as “handmade” items, and they are drop-shipping from sites like wish and aliexpress for a huge markup. The move to officially allow drop-shipping goes against their mission statement of being anti-fast fashion and pro-sustainability. 

This ruins the experience for buyers, which, in turn, hurts sellers and cheapens the overall experience of using the app. 

I enjoy Depop for many reasons. I like the layout, the simplicity of buying and selling, the option to ship internationally, and I love the community of sustainable fashion enthusiasts. And I understand that not everyone cares about sustainable fashion, but promoting drop-shippers and dishonest sellers hurts everyone that uses this app. If things continue to move in this direction, I may find myself sticking to local thrift stores rather than buying on Depop.",False,2019-05-24 20:58:14,"{'id': 8920364, 'body': 'Thanks for this feedback, class of 2015 is the best.

I've reported both times which went absolutely nowhere. I just get automated message after automated message and the problem doesn't get fixed. Getting a refund is really down to the seller and like I said if they're not honest, well depop doesn't really care and it'll take 180 days to make a dispute with PayPal.

 I use mercari a lot now and they float your money instead of giving it directly to the sellers PayPal so you don't have to worry that the sellers are taking money and not shipping items or else they don't get that money.

1,beckyturtler,Hated Selling on Depop,"So I had a good rare hoodie to sell and I didn’t want to sell it to friends or on my other selling apps so I could try to get it for it’s worth. I got depop because people sell things like that there the most. I wanted it for $60, a customer and I came to an agreement on $50... i ended up with less than $30!!!
Little did I know, you have to connect paypal to it. Depop takes out their fee for selling on their app which is a hefty percent. Paypal takes out a fee as well. AND even though I had the shipping (which I much rather sell local and in person but had no option) marked as customer pays, I payed $13 TWICE for shipping because my shipping label wouldn’t load. 
Then I had to update the shipping tracking which was impossible when you bought two labels and couldn’t find which was the one you used on the box. 
And now here I am with no hoodie because it’s with the buyer and NO MONEY. because paypal has my money on hold. Which apparently happens when you’re new to paypal or the shipping needs updating. Then I tried a million ways to update it and void shipping labels. Paypal says it needs a day after the package arrives to lift the hold...
BEEN ABOUT TWO WEEKS!

Love the App! Is it just me or did the option to swap the order of pictures go away? Please bring it back please!

The main one being that no matter what you do as far as turning on notifications, the app does not send a notification when something is sold, or when a customer messages you. This is especially problematic because depop is not my full time job and I am not checking the app constantly. Since the app literally won’t send notifications, this has caused issues with customers thinking I’m ignoring them, when really I just am not being told that I have a message.

2,GGLOVES1D,Depop and PayPal percentages,"Hi everyone, I was having a huge problem with getting any money at all since Depop and PayPal both get a percentage from my sale. If anyone else has this problem I’d try shipping without using Depop and using your own shipping when posting your item. Here’s how they do things here in Depop (this is from an email i received from them) 
**Listing items for sale on Depop is completely free but we apply a 10% commission fee on all items sold. This could show up on your PayPal activity as an ""advertising"" fee but this is just how PayPal have chosen to word it. We won’t ever take a fee for listing.

Be aware that a PayPal transaction fee also applies to all successful sales which is 2.9% + $0.30 PayPal commission. These fees are automatically deducted before the payment reaches your PayPal account.

If the fee is higher than 10%, this is likely because you selected Ship With Depop. When you Ship With Depop, as a seller you’ll be charged the cost of the shipping label and the Depop fee in one go, these deductions wont show up separately on your PayPal activity page.

1,Pey0628,Disappointed,"I am a longtime Depop user with 80 items sold and over 150 purchased, but I am extremely disappointed in their new drop shipping policy and will probably switch to another reselling app. Dropshipping is a practice in which sellers list items being sold on AliExpress or similar sites for 3-4x their actual price, and when Depop users buy them, the seller orders the item off AliExpress and inputs the sellers address as the shipping destination. The item is never actually in the seller’s possession. I, along with many others, have enjoyed using Depop because it is a way to escape the exploitation of fast fashion and support small businesses, and this new approval of dropshippers goes against all of that. Dropshipping exploits the buyer and most of all the factory workers who make the clothes in horrible working conditions.

This app however, takes a big piece of your sale, which I do not find fair. Yes, they are providing a free platform for you to sell your stuff within your country or possibly internationally (may be an off-app transaction) but, that does not mean you scam your users into thinking you only take 10% of their sales, when in reality, Depop takes more. I sold something for $50 the other day and received $42. 10% of 50 is $45. What happened to my other three dollars worth of profit? Depop needs to clear up their waters when it comes to fees.

While I have had a few good transactions (both buying & selling) I recently sold an item where I was honest to the buyer and told them I did not purchase shipping with tracking. Tracking is not required on the app and shipping is bought by the seller. The buyer then opened a dispute with me and claimed she never received her package. When Depop contacted me and I expressed my concerns about not doing anything wrong & not having protection.. they pretty much said, “Sorry get tracking next time then”. Poshmark includes a tracked shipping label when you sell an item - SO much easier and does not cost the buyer anything. GET POSHMARK INSTEAD!! Also, Depop does not require buyers to allow refunds which I think is funny because if a dispute is opened then you have no choice.

Lots of great qualities such as how easy it is to find the item your looking for, extremely kind people (for the most part), and It’s really easy to sell things.

Another thing that I notified is that people on Depop tend to sell their items for a lot more (probably because of the tax they put on the seller) compared to Poshmark.

1,CarBabe21,Not very good,Change the colors scheme and the logo it’s hideous. This app needs a lot of work still but it is an ok app to sell on not sure about buying never bought anything from this app. There needs to be a way where you can advertise everyones items on the home page or the explore section not just certain people or profiles. This app only focuses on certain profile pages and certain items that I think isnt good for example the app will advertise 5 different items from the same closet or page. I don’t understand why it is set up this way but I think you guys need to focus on other people as well and show new listings in the home page so people can discover new items and profiles but putting the focus on high profile pages with people who already have a high number of sales and followers isnt fair.

5,101:))!,I love it but it doesn’t work on me a lot and having issues with it,I love love depop I found clothes I’ve been wanting to dress like and some good deals but I hate how some people overprice items.. when they got it from a thrift store and resell them to a hire price... I also hate how there’s rude people on there and would block you for no reason 😭 but hey that’s every where online. But the app itself is good except it’s annoying how I have to keep unstalling depop because it would not let me go in the app and it exit me out where I have to delete depop and then get the app again.

You’re able to use pre pads  shipping labels which is soooo nice especially since they’re cheaper for me than going to the post office.

So, the buying experience really feels more personal. You can also message the seller, which is a tool I used A LOT and it was really helpful in the buying process.

But other than that, I still shopped on depop more cautiously, but now the app is way less appealing to me because the new layout is, there’s two rows of whatever you’re searching for which means more scrolling and more time spent on me trying to find what I want.

4,jrooney08,"So Far, I Love It","I have had an enjoyable time using this app. I am both a buyer and a new seller. So far, I haven’t run into any big issues. I do my own shipping (not Depop’s), so the process of packaging and going to the post office is easy/straightforward. 

Depop is a good way to be scammed as a buyer if you aren’t proactive. I typically Google any item (or something similar by the brand) I’m interested in before purchasing, just in case the seller is inflating the price. It’s also better to purchase from someone with a lot of sales/reviews, and who has a consistent feed and possibly poses wearing their items themselves. 

My only complaint is Depop’s large cut. They have to make money somehow, but between shipping, Depop’s fee, taxes, and packaging, the amount I receive in the end is dramatically reduced. This is why, I’m sure, a lot of items are overpriced: The seller actually wants to make a profit. Bundle buying with free shipping is a blessing and a curse for this reason. 

Overall, I recommend the app. It’s a fun way to make extra money, or find niche things for your closet.",False,2020-11-16 20:30:16,"{'id': 19390701, 'body': ""Hey, thanks for the review.

1,NickPerry99,No customer service,"Long story short, I purchased a Louis Vuitton keychain and after 11 days of not shipping the seller told me they did not have the item and they blocked me. 

Depop does not have any customer service. When I emailed them it took 3 days to get a response. Which was utterly pathetic and useless. 

It has since been 34 day’s since my purchase and still no response from Depop or a refund. 

Depop told me that it’s not their problem and only PayPal can help. 

Depop claims to have a policy which after 7 days since an order is placed the seller must ship the item or the buyer is refunded. Well it’s been 34 days and Depop hasn’t given me a cent. 

I have since deleted this scam app as it’s way to risky especially when purchasing expensive items. 

In addition I would also like to note that about 95% of all designer items on Depop are counterfeit. Like most everything is Fake. Depop does absolutely nothing about this. 

Recently I have noticed people are beginning to sell looted luxury items and Depop does nothing.

4,nichrob,"Great Way To Sell Stuff, Clunky Social Media Aspects","Some of the features that need a bit of work: 
-Sending photo/video through private messages.
-Submitting money offers through private messages that the seller can accept with one click.
-Maybe blocking people from posting things that aren't items they have for sale.
-The option to share your shop on Instagram feels dated and looks bland. I know you can't post links in captions on Instagram but the template of items displayed could look better. 
-General tactile feel of the app is a bit slow as far as liking things, clicking notifications, etc.
-This is a bit far fetched, but maybe a sale feature where you could select a group of items and drop or raise them in price by percentage all at once instead of doing it all manually.

Two of my items were bought and I couldn’t access their shipping label OR payment due to the pay pal issue. I tried contacting Depop and I didn’t hear back. My customers were waiting and I had to do it manually where they sent me their address and had to pay me through venmo....

4,Hiyori0w0,"Great for my niche, UX design could use work","I wear and sell jfashion (Japanese fashion) exclusively, which is too niche for Poshmark and Mercari. I love selling on Depop because it has a super active jfashion community and I can always sell stuff quickly. 

However, I must say that the UX and UI design could use a lot more work. Please take a look at Vinted for inspiration. I think they have the best UX out of all the seller apps (unfortunately no users though). 

Some UX issues I have with Depop: every time I add a new listing, I have to choose my shipping details, which is really tedious. Please just default it. 4 photos per listing is too restrictive. Doesn't show me how much I'll get when I set the price. No way to do bundles. Can't change shipping (to correct for over-weight shipments) or cancel order after it's placed. Can't change the tracking to my own tracking if I end up having to change shipping.

Also, it would be great if I don't have to go through Paypal, since Paypal takes an extra cut on top of the 10% Depop fee. Mercari does direct deposits and I love that.",False,2018-03-01 00:17:12,"{'id': 2766636, 'body': ""Hey there!

- To add more photos if listing an item. I get a lot of requests to try on a product, or post dimensions. I would love to add more photos without creating a new post or removing pictures from current post.

My recommendation is that there should be more filters created, as the current ones don’t always work in more specific searches. Filters recommended include allowing users to buy from sellers based in their same country or internationally (helps with shipping and seller preference), color of the item, and advance filtering for hashtags, actual header of the item, or other (some sellers tag irrelevant hashtags to increase exposure).

Poshmark, Mercari and Vinted are all far more worth your time to sell or buy clothes. I highly recommend Poshmark if you want to be charged with less fees, receive seller protection and have acceptable customer service. 

There are far better clothing selling platforms that do NOT make you face more fees by going through PayPal as a third party.

PayPal refunded the buyer, the buyer took off with the item, and PayPal just said “contact the buyer to receive your money in some other way (which means “you’re outta luck”).

One thing that could be improved is the area where you can sort your likes into groups. Whenever I try to do it the app kind of freaks out because of all the changes being made and then glitches to say I have zero likes or groups for a bit. 

A recommendation I have is to be able to click on a group and then have an “add to this group option” where you could then pick from your past ‘likes’ to organize into that specific group. Currently when you want to put a previously liked item into a new group you have to dislike it, like it again, and then pick the desired group which is a hassle and causes the app to glitch like I said before if you’re trying to do it too fast. 

Basically, for a quick summary, it’d be nice to organize your past likes more easily into new folders.",False,2020-01-07 04:50:52,"{'id': 12793867, 'body': ""Hey. Thanks for the feedback.

However, I would really like to see a better online interface that can be accessed on the computer. Online shopping is usually easier online rather than on an app, and Depop is great in that their app is amazing (probably because it’s intended to be an app), but I would also like to shop Depop on a web browser on my computer.

If a seller doesn’t communicate the shipping info, there’s no way for me to leave a review.

If you choose “ship with depop”, the buyer will pay for shipping but once you ship, an “automatic payment” to depop will come out of your paypal for “shipping + a depop fee.” Which is super annoying and I ended up paying out of pocket for shipping even though I chose an option that made it seem like the buyer would pay for shipping.

The search engine is horrible, people are barely getting likes or traffic in their shops. Top sellers seem to be the only ones making sales.

Well... These purchases are great, thus far. Two have arrived already in great condition and the next one comes tomorrow. In brief, this app scratches a type of itch that I and many others seem to relate to. We wanna buy cool clothing from other people like us or independent clothing businesses. 

Here's where I took a star off. The explore page could use... um.. work.

When I open it, there are great colors, great quality products, and great photography...

I just wish there were more specific categories and some more “unisex” options for clothes like t shirts and hoodies. Also a category for toys and collectibles which is mainly what I try and sell, but since I have to put it in the kids or home category every post usually gets lost. 

I see a lot of complaints about the feature/explore page and I agree to an extent. Why have sold items there? And why feature the same big sellers when there’s plenty of small accounts with great items/images. 

Another suggestion would be to let sellers send images through private message and to be able to add more photos to the original listing. I like to see a gallery of images and I’m sure many other buyers agree as well.

I contacted customer service and they were no help at all, saying that the labels expire after 30 days (which in several instances I’ve seen is not true)

The platform is great if they focused on giving everyone a fair shot at being featured and promoted-not just the 10k+ accounts who resell thrifted items.

Being I wish they would set up a direct deposit like every other selling app I use. Depops percentage fee is low, however, you have to tack in the PayPal transfer fee too. So if I make $20 off an item afterwards it’s more like I made $16/$17. Still not a horrible deal but other apps would give you more. So competitively it falls a bit short.

2,MauiGurl👍👍👍,All fun and games until you get screwed.,"I love that I can find things I want at a good price, but I am so sick of being scammed out of my money. Several times I’ve had great experiences with sellers, but I’m done. There is zero protection from PayPal, which is the most useless transaction site ever. I ordered a jacket, which was never sent to me even after I contacted them. I filed a dispute, PayPal made me run around in circles for days trying to get my money back, and they just stopped helping me. The seller blocked me, and I never got the jacket or the refund.
I also ordered a belt, and the seller shipped it, and it got lost. There is zero protection for this either. I’ve wasted so much money on scams and items I never received.

3,nastygum,good start but still needs a lot of work,"i think my main issue with this app is its overall lack of personalization, specifically with the ""for you"" section. when you create a depop account and give the app your sizes, the ""for you"" page should also be catered to these sizes. speaking as someone with an eating disorder, i am waaaaaaay less likely to want to use this app specifically because the ""for you"" page is full of clothes that simply will not fit me. the sizes of the user should be considered when whatever algorithm creates that page.

another frontrunner for big issues in my opinion is the huge amount of people who are clearly partnering with or simply ordering from shein, aliexpress, etc. who will sell ""several sizes"" of an item when they are simply getting it from somewhere else. i dont think depop should be a front for these fast fashion companies to make money, and should instead be what depop describes itself as, which is something like thrifting but on your phone.",False,2020-08-03 22:23:28,"{'id': 17329796, 'body': ""Hey.

1,Mwhaahahahaha,Use Mercari or posh mark instead!

3,Felipe Franco,"Cool Concept, but Hard To Sell Due To “Exclusivity”","I’ve been selling on Depop for a little over a month. The app shows great promise, but it’s a bit exclusive when it comes to who you see on the featured page. It’s the same people over and over again. Nothing wrong with that, but they should make another explore tab that features more items from everyone, rather than the exclusively chosen popular ones.

How about having a newly posted, or randomizer option for the view? Give us more options to discover the rest of the Depop community.

Seeing the same people in the featured page gets old real fast, and a bit unfair to the rest of the community. It kind of creates a divide between the Cool and the “not-Cool-enough” sellers. 

If that divide can be gapped, and everyone gets more of a chance to show what they have this app would be amazing. Right now it just feels limited.

Their social events are cliquey and even depop social media promotes people who are already popular instead of promoting underdogs or growing more new people’s follower/buyer base which would effectively create more sales for them........ they are open ears to suggestions but have little resources to implement- also since they are based in UK everything takes forever to communicate.

3,Sarahtheapplover,over priced items,i’ve had this app for a while and i used to be able to buy USED stuff at a reasonable price (which it should be considering it’s used) but lately people selling things are selling them above retail and way over priced. the more people who over price their items the more likely others are to do the same. depop also takes a sorta big chunk out of the money when someone buys something from you and it’s very annoying. i sold an item for $10 and was hoping to get $10 from it but depop took some out of it and i got $4 which is annoying,False,2020-04-05 18:29:39,"{'id': 14485923, 'body': ""Hey Sarah, it sounds like you may have a shipping label selected for that sale, if you don't need it no problem, just contact our support team who will be happy to refund it.\n\nStay safe, stay at home, stay you,\nTeam Depop"", 'modified': '2020-04-06T11:00:25Z'}"

4,@cristymariepoplin,So far so good!,"Pretty cool app. Only real complaint is we should be able to upload more than 4 pictures per post. We should be able to post at least 10 pictures per post--just a suggestion! I do like the app.

Edit: Selling is pretty easy. You just need to post listings with good pictures and detailed descriptions. You can sell 3 items one day and absolutely nothing the next. You certainly need a big following to make a decent amount of money on this app. This seems doable if you’re willing to put in the effort.

Please PLEASE fix your notifications settings!! I will check the notifications I receive, but they will not go away from my screen afterwards. 
When we list something, it would be so much more convenient to actually know how much we would make if our item sold for the price we list for. It is already confusing to learn how much, and all other platforms inform us how much we could make on a set price or an offer sent
Also, it would be really nice to be able to send private offers to oilers

3,WEINUSSSS,"good, but could improve","i’ve had depop for a while and have sold a couple things on there. the platform is simple to use, but it’s not one of my main selling sites, and there are some things i believe depop could improve upon:

1. more than 4 photos per listing max.
as someone who likes to be thorough with their listings & photos, the 4 photo limit per listing is definitely inconvenient. it would be nice if i could upload more than 4 (perhaps up to 8 photos like mercari & poshmark).

2. built-in profit calculations
depop states that it takes 10% commission and paypal takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. i remember reading on depop’s zendesk that the depop fee deducted will vary depending on your shipping method (i.e., whether or not depop will take 10% from the entire transaction total or just the cost of the item(s) w/o shipping costs). it would be nice to have a built in profit calculator that tells you how much you’ll make after depop + paypal fees based on your listing price and selected shipping method.

3. web support
although depop is currently supported on a web browser (you can edit and rearrange your photos online), adding an option to list from the web would definitely be beneficial, especially to people who list quicker on laptops/desktops.

i know depop is constantly improving its app, and i hope these improvements will be implemented in the future!",False,2018-12-09 11:04:07,"{'id': 6340162, 'body': 'These are some amazing feedbacks!

1,Monskittles,Selling Fees,"Depop claims that 10% of the sellers item price counts as a fee, SELLERS BE AWARE that not only do they take 10%, but also take shipping costs, AND PAYPAL CHARGES YOU ALSO THEIR 3.7whatever% 
so you’re ultimately making LESS than you would on Mercari. only reason im still using this app is because you get instant payment and dont have to wait for an item to be delivered and a review to be left for you to get the funds from the transaction.
1/5

edit hence the developers response: The money for shipping is never returned back into my paypal, you guys take a percentage of the item which is 10% then paypal takes their % and ontop of that you take an initial fee % from the shipping cost so in total it’s almost as much as posh’s fees.",True,2018-03-21 07:52:02,"{'id': 2878880, 'body': ""Hey there!

1,wassupyaz,I would give it none,There’s honestly so much cool stuff on depop but so many scumbags as well. Depop does not help at all by enabling them to not require a tracking number and on top of that unless they use the shipping label by depop you cannot review which is ridiculous. Ive gotten my money taken multiple times by people who never ship the item and although they give you your money back it doesnt help no one will ever know this person will not send the item because you can’t even leave a review!!! And if u do get your item it’ll be whenever And u wont know because they did not use the label. I will no longer use depop until they fix this and maybe not even then.,False,2018-03-14 19:29:25,
1,Tewrd Fewrgason,No customer service,"The idea of this app is great but when it comes down to it it's like dealing with children. Once an item is purchased and paid for, the buyer is at the sellers mercy. I had 3 separate transactions all at once to give this app a shot. Once I paid for the items, I had to hound all three buyers separately to actually ship the items I paid for. I made my purchases SIX days ago and only one item has arrived. The item that arrived was not as described with an obvious stain on it. The seller asked me ""what was he supposed to do about it"". Want me to pay for shipping and fees to return a stained item.

i also think this app needs to work on more protection for the buyers, like hold the funds until the purchase is completed to prevent scams (like how mercari holds the money until the seller and buyer have rated each other). i think that doing this will make people be a bit more comfortable with shopping on depop and not have to worry about not receiving an item. 

another thing is the support, i think depop support is lagging a bit. i recommend having a support chat or something, emails take a long time for a response. 

i also forgot about dropshippers, i don’t like how they charge so much money for the price they pay for and they don’t even use their own photos. it’s unfair to people on depop trying to get cheap items. 

overall, depop is an amazing app with a bright future ahead. it just needs improvement, like any other app.

Negatives: The fees are too high for their poor customer service. If you’re gonna take 10%, make sure to respond to people in a timely manner. Making us wait over a week for a response is absurd. 

Finally, it is really annoying that my “for you” curated items are all from the UK. I live in the USA and only purchase items from my country due to shipping time. Please allow me to filter USA only options.

I’ve contacted PayPal and had a lengthy conversation with them, to no solution, and they ultimately told me to contact Depop, in which I did, and have not heard back.

1,Make Depop Great Again!,Drop shipping,"Supports and encourages recycling and refurbished clothing, but allows a platform for drop shippers to sell? Please don’t take the easy way out to make money. Instead work on other interfaces that can help sellers sell:

1) Allow videos to be moved to the back of the listed item, so the seller can show the pictures before the video.

2) maybe inpatient a offer button to to help the transaction a bit smoother. You’ll end up having a bunch of people using that “offer” button and probably end up getting more sales = fee money

3) adding a % discount for bundles, just like how you implement “free shipping for bundles” so it’s easy for people just to purchase without asking and waiting for the seller to create a “bundle post”.

1. The ability to follow hashtags or set up alerts for certain keywords. 
2. Have the search page remember the spot you were at if you accidentally swipe backwards to the previous search inquiry. 
3. Broaden the “search by brand” feature. Right now there are very little brands to choose from. Switch it to user entered data to allow for obscure brands to be searchable.

5,Stefan Chebultz,a couple of things,"i use this app a lot. i make a lot of money on selling and it’s great, by far my fav one to use ever. 

but a couple of smallish things from a sellers pov: 

the “ships in x days” thing needs work. i know last year i was on vacation for a couple of weeks and didn’t ship during that time, so now it says “ships in 5 days” which is super off. i ship same/next day unless it’s sunday. if y’all could make it where you gather shipment from an x amount of items/time and average based on that, it’d be better for us all. i think there are potential buyers turned off by the thought i won’t ship it right away. 

a thing that would be super cool is if we had the ability to search for already sold items. if a seller wants to reference something for a price idea or if buyers are curious what a good price to pay would be, have that ability would be awesome. i know ebay and etsy (maybe) has this ability

those two aren’t deal breakers, they’d just make it an even greater app than it already is! thanks :))

3,Yo mama ugly as u know whut,ACTIVE SELLER REVIEW!!!,"I’ve been using depop for over a year now and I have a Love/Hate relationship with the app. Over time the interface has gotten far better and less buggy (good job development team). Other changes weren’t so good; like the increase of shipping fees and percentage based fee system. If you sell an item for $300 you will loose an unsettling portion of your profits to the middle man. If depop capped the max fee the app would run 30x smoother and everyone would be happy. 

My honest Feedback,

1,Kayla a.k.a Fuzzy,Not the best,I’ve been selling on multiple other platforms for 6 years and do very well. It is impossible to get your items seen on Depop unless you constantly list and relist which is a waste of time. I’ve never had a problem with my photos ( clear photos and on a mannequin) but Depop makes me feel like those are not acceptable. I made a few sales with my first account. My second account I haven’t had any luck so will probably be moving on. It would be nice if we could share items or if they were bumped when we lower the price.,False,2018-06-21 02:13:12,

1. Paypal holds the money and will literally not release it unless the buyer says okay- or you wait 21 days. Then if the buyer doesn’t like you or whatever the case they don’t wanna go the extra mile to get on a computer and release your money.

3. It’s like retry payment, overnight ? My whole account is shut down and it’s literally still taking money it’s ridiculous I didn’t even sell. You guys need money that bad?? No.

Depop also picks the saaaame shops to highlight on the search page with the same goodwill sweaters from the 80s. Annoying for a hardworking seller that would love a little exposure. 

I do like the shipping option tiers and that the money goes directly to my PayPal and I don’t have to wait. Other than that, Poshmark is the better platform for sellers in my opinion.

Poshmark has a pickier buyer but a bit older with jobs and money to spend. I have also experienced wayyyy less policing of my profile.

This happened with Mercari and they gave me a Mercari credit to use for the inconvenience. 

It would be nice if Depop provided a credit to use when things like this happened rather then the buyer having to message them seller and when the seller doesn’t reply or doesn’t take responsibility, the buyer then has to resort to a chargeback.

sellers want to make the exact amount of money they put on there depop items, the 10% selling fee has to go!
Especially if we add our own shipping price as well it shouldnt be included with the selling fees!
Atleast only charge the fees on the item price but not our shipping price!
The higher the price the higher the selling fees will be an its honestly not fair for us to make the money we want to make!

one of these is brandy melville auctions. depop needs to do more to stop these. they’re taking up my feed, my “recommended”, and honestly, i’m so sick of watching people trying to auction these things for $80+, when they’re worth $20. 

also, there needs to be more moderating to help with scamming. i’ve witnessed lots of people trying to scam. 

also, my phone slows down when i try to type my description on the app. i’m not sure if it’s the app, but it takes forever just to write a description of an item. 

last of all, why would you remove the ability to insert as many hashtags as you want? now you made it harder for people to find your items 🤦‍♀️

1,SabtheBabe,Just don’t use it,"1. I bought a nickel board off a guy over a year ago and he cancelled the shipment because the shipping (due to weight) would be too expensive. Never got my payment back.

2. I bought a sweater off a girl and all went well. I got the sweater, loved it, the end, right? NOPE. She messaged me a week later saying she “accidentally denied the payment” so now it’s MY responsibility to send her another payment????

3. I bought a dress over 10 days ago and the seller says she shipped it however it’s not being tracked. We are both confused.

unfortunately, i was a victim of fraud and it resulted in a loss of over $200 after the buyer claimed i never sent them their products. they then blocked me. because paypal requires confirmation that the product was received by the buyer, the matter went unresolved as they blocked me & never updated.
 i tried to resolve this so many times with both paypal and depop, sending them proof of shipment. one depop representative did not understand the issue i was having and instead blamed me for using my own shipping label, rather than one provided by depop. they said “if you can’t ship with depop, don’t ship at all”. this not only was not my issue but it was downright rude.

5,😃hola☺️,TERRIBLE APP,I have had a Depop for a few months now and I’ve had a few sales and I never had a problem with my registration with my PayPal account connected to my Depop everything was perfectly synced and I was all approved. I was able to ship all my items having the shipping labels all fine but in my last sale I have a perv a problem that I have not been able to print out my label because of a problem with Depop and PayPal. When I reached out to PayPal they say it’s not their problem and that to reach out to Deepak I reached out to Depop several times throughout the emails and I’ve gotten responses back and then been totally ignored over email!! Alongside this a Depop is a very hard app to manage you cannot just delete your account you have to email the company which is very confusing why there is a point in doing that!! And there is a lot of hidden fees that are in Depop you may think that using Poshmark is worse because there’s a 20% reduction in pay instead of a 10% and the pop is actually tricking you and taking a bunch of money once you see it in your PayPal. Overall I am very disappointed with the customer service in Depop ignoring me several times having no one to call no phone numbers if they don’t even respond to their emails! I’ve had this problem with a buyer over a week because of Depop to be able to give me my shipping label which I’ve been able to do so many times before and I do not want to get bad reviews because of an issue that I have not caused!

5,User of 3 months,I absolutely love Depop.,"I've been using Depop for about a year and a half now, and I've personally done well selling and purchased some awesome items. I've been featured twice on the explore page, and I'm not by any means ""Depop famous"". I have a little over a thousand followers. One of my items was featured when I had about 400 followers. I've noticed in the reviews a lot of people are complaining about not getting their items on the explore page. If you're not getting featured it's because your photos or your items don't meet certain standards, not because you're not ""Depop famous"". If you really look at featured items, plenty of them are owned by small accounts, sometimes with no reviews. ""Depop famous"" people are popular and get featured often because they have great photos and items. I've used every selling app available, and Depop is BY FAR my favorite. Insanely easy to use, with a unique, generally very friendly, vintage-appreciating community of people. I've had small problems with only a couple of buyers, but none with sellers, and I've worked the issues that did arise out with Depop, and the buyers, and it turned out just fine. The Depop team has always been helpful and kind when I've communicated with them. Before Depop, I used Mercari, which I got scammed on numerous times as a buyer and seller, and ultimately had my money stolen from me by the app itself, and only had robots to communicate with, who were of no help. (Not to mention, Mercari is full of children, rude buyers, and thousands upon thousands of counterfeit item sellers.) Depop is so, so so much better than anything else out there. I love it, and I hope it continues to grow, yet maintain its unique atmosphere. You should try it, if you haven't already.",False,2018-08-18 13:27:51,"{'id': 4729517, 'body': ""Thanks for the really great feedback here - it's very useful to see such good tips for new Sellers so we appreciate this and super happy to have you on Depop :)"", 'modified': '2018-08-20T09:05:07Z'}"

The fee is in place to keep the app up and running, with general up-keep costs and to pay all of our employees, from engineers to us in support. \n\nUnlike many other selling platforms, at Depop only charge you when you make a sale, this means there are no fees for the length of time your item has been listed for or any initial costs to list the item, so list to your heart’s content because its all free!\n\nLove, Depop', 'modified': '2018-11-19T11:10:57Z'}"

5,Dcusha🎓,Amazing customer service+quality,"I don’t usually write reviews on apps, but the service and help I’ve received from the Depop team has been INCREDIBLE. I got into a really unfortunate situation with a buyer whose real goal was to scam me into selling a beautiful prom dress for almost free with promise to not just to pay a discounted price I offered because her own prom was approaching, but also promise to pay for the $50 express shipping to her remote town in the middle of nowhere. She lied many times that she would send me items from her own Depop to pay for the shipping but eventually just turned rude and abusive, harassing me and calling me unpleasant names before blocking me after receiving the dress. I was pretty upset, as I had really loved the dress and it was hard enough to part from it, let alone get scammed into losing almost 80% of what I paid for it by some mean girl. I tried to figure out my options, but with her having me blocked on basically ALL social media accounts, it was hard. I reached out to customer service, who promptly responded and gave me almost unbeatable service and help. They were kind, responsive, and seemed genuinely interested in helping me figure out this situation. Eventually, after giving some screenshots forward (and even though they were quite old by the time I pursued the case) I was able to find them helping me by reaching out to her account requesting she pay me back. Eventually her account did not respond (typical of her at this point lol) and they had her account suspended, which is an amazing amount of dedication to the real buyers and sellers on Depop who don’t scam and who just want to do real, true business. Not only did they protect future Depop users from getting scammed and harassed too, but they also offered to fully refund me for the entire shipping cost. All in all, an amazing experience with the Depop app and customer service. If you’re looking for a buyer/seller marketplace with genuinely and thoughtful admin, look no further!!

4,Orange apples 365,"love depop, hate depop rules","i love depop, i think it’s so much fun and so interesting to find handmade items, jewelry, art, antiques, all different styles of clothing, wigs, etc. everyone is so friendly, prices are cheap & shipping is generally fast depending on the seller. This app is like a trendy thrift shop, just you can shop in your bed. However, it can be VERY irritating at times. I was logging in and forgot my password, i tried probably 4 times before getting the notification that i had to wait 23 hours to get back into my account. I found it extremely EXTREMELY ridiculous:/ most apps send you an email and have you reset your password. this is so much more convenient. I also during this process was informed that i had an account that i genuinely had no idea existed. it’s a depop rule that you can only have one account. so even though i had no idea i had an old account, i was suspended from the account i use for around 36 hours. this again, was absolutely ridiculous. it took depop a very long time to contact me back, and they have no number to call and talk to a customer service representative. the actual app is awesome. the rules and customer service.... not so awesome. i highly recommend fixing and chilling out on some of these rules because i think you could definitely lose some depop users over the excessive nature of the rules. however if like me you would like to use this app until they fix it, don’t do what i did and just hit the accept button on the rules, read them all, believe me it’s worth it, the trouble you go through to fix it all isn’t worth it!! hope this helps",False,2018-05-29 02:25:13,

4,j.m.gorgonzola,quality of life?,"overall, this is a great app. i started my resale journey on a much smaller app, and although depop has gotten me more sales, there are some QoL pieces that would be great to see in the future.
one being a kind of vacation mode. this is what led me to write the review. if we had a way of flipping a setting on and off that made it obvious to any potential buyers viewing your page/items that things cannot be shipped/messages cannot be responded to for the time it is on, i think that would ease a lot of sellers’ minds and destress buyers who realize only after purchasing that the seller is not currently available. i think it is unfair to assume buyers will look through someone’s feed to see if they’re out of town, etc.
second being a way to see what has sold. not just by viewing and scrolling a specific sellers’ page, but perhaps as a search filter. it would be a nice way to get pricing ideas based on stuff that /has/ sold and not things that haven’t yet. 
third: the ability to list items under multiple categories. i struggle to list what i’m selling because often clothing can be worn by all genders. this in turn affects searching as well. i find tees for my boyfriend while searching women’s wear. y’know, unisex stuff and all. 
these suggestions aside, i really appreciate how easy it is to use depop. the message feature is a game changer and there’s no begging for reviews. i experienced a spam bot, and the account was deleted less than an hour after i reported it. so!! wonderful in the grand scheme of things, but improvements can always be made. ♡",False,2019-11-28 07:08:26,"{'id': 12107727, 'body': ""Hey.

4,SuperPenguin645,"Depop is good, but not as good as others.","Personally, I like depop because of the awesome creativeness to it. All the photos are nice and colorful and pop out, its fun just to look at how people photograph their items without even wanting to buy anything. Overall, for a buyer, it's great. As a seller though, I have some issues. The main issue being the payment methods and process. As someone who sells on Mercari and Poshmark as well as Depop, I've found that Depop makes receiving payment overly complicated. The first thing I don't particularly enjoy is that payment can only be through paypal. Both Mercari and Poshmark do direct bank transfers. This eliminates the 2.9% + 30¢ that PayPal takes on top of Depop's 10% commission. The second thing, and probably my least favorite is that when you make a sale, Depop  transfers you the total price of the purchase, including shipping (regardless of who pays) and Depop fees, then takes the shipping price and Depop fee amount out of your bank account. Why Depop can't do like Mercari and just give the seller what they earned, is beyond me. It makes finances more complicated to keep track of. My third issue with Depop is the explore page/feed. It only ever features the same people who already have thousands of followers. They never seem to give the little guys a chance, even when they have just as good or better pictures than the big guys. A fourth issue of mine is being unable to SEARCH for sold items. While you can go on someone's page to find what they've sold, it's not the same as searching for an exact comp of what you're selling. However, aside from these issues, Depop is a great platform with some great features, such as being able to refresh your posts without dropping the price. Communicating between buyer and seller is also very easy on Depop. Overall a good app, just wish some things were tweaked.",False,2019-02-26 03:06:00,"{'id': 7522484, 'body': ""Hi there, thank you for giving us some feedback.

4,Peenyweenyy,As a Seller & Buyer,"I have found my favorite clothing items from Depop. It has helped me curate a closet almost entirely second hand from this site, other resell sites & thrifting. 

As a buyer, the prices can get outrageous and honestly annoying knowing most items are sourced for more than half the asking price (but if you sort by price, do a lot of digging etc and it’s no big deal). And most times the items are crazy unique, vintage, beautiful and hard to find and as a seller I know why the prices are so high. Most shop owners put a lot of care into their brand and customer service more than any resell app. It’s fun to shop on this app; the same fun I have with thrifting. 

As a seller, this app easy to navigate. The fees can get annoying but not as expensive as other resell apps (Etsy, etc). The profit margin can get pretty slim with all of the fees and shipping costs, and often times you need a large inventory to combat that. Right now i’m just a small closet seller and only selling old items from my personal closet so I’m not losing money from buying inventory. If I was my prices would hike up and buyers don’t often understand why, creating a lot of hate off app. The Depop buyer demographic tends to sway younger and if you market the item right, can sell successfully with time despite being a smaller shop. Depop has worked on lessening the amount of dropshippers present on the app, though there are some that are still some drop shops taking advantage of buyers on here (Depop needs to make a warning guide for buyers. Tips on how to know which shops droppship and how to avoid them would be helpful). Customers are generally well mannered and this app has good buyer/seller protection. There are a lot of flaws but overall this single app has created a crazy creative and diverse community of fashion lovers. It’s one of the bigger apps that has popularized second hand fashion and I have more pros than cons.",False,2020-11-20 20:31:29,"{'id': 19391245, 'body': ""Hey. Thanks for the feedback.

4,Cakepopkam,Pretty amazing,"It’s a very great app with people who are trying to recycle/sell used clothes AND most of the items are very unique looking, in style, and overall affordable. I would recommend to anyone. However, I am only giving 4 stars, not because of the app itself, but it seems a little too easy for someone to rip you off (it hasn’t happened yet but it can get pretty close). Luckily there’s a communication system you can use between buyers and sellers. Almost all the sellers I’ve met on there is very nice, keeps you informed about shipping, and are very honest about small defaults in clothing (I.e small holes, stains, sizes). However I did come into contact with one person who did not keep me informed about shipping and took nearly two weeks just to get around to shipping it, if I had not messaged them asking/reminding them to do so, (because of the their own policy that sellers can make themselves, such as no refunds) they could have blocked me and I would have had no chance of getting my money back unless i directly filed a complaint against them to depop. However, I did resolve it, by asking politely and offering help. As a buyer, you should be very particular as to how you treat the sellers (I’ll elaborate as to why in a moment); but try not to let that situation steer you away from the app, I would just use the app with caution (you should real the sellers policy/reviews before buying from them, then you should be good). Anyway, last point to make is please, as a buyer, be respectful and patient toward the sellers, and share concerns and questions. It will benefit both you and the seller if you approach a situation with an open mind, patience, and respectfulness. Also, not only do seller have reviews, but buyers do aswell. Almost every seller will make a review on a buyer, if you have a low review BUYERS CAN REJECT THEIR SERVICE! BUT if you think a seller is being unfair you can report/block them.",False,2018-12-16 20:41:18,"{'id': 6451249, 'body': ""Thank you so much for taking the time to give us some feedback.

4,lilyandrist,Really awesome app— some thoughts about reviews,"I’ve been selling on depop for just a few months now and really enjoying the app. It’s for the most part a very positive and supportive space and very user friendly. I really like the aesthetic of the app and how the shops appear. 

I just wanted to leave some feedback because I think that depop could greatly improve the buyer experience by removing the option for sellers to rate buyers. I’ve noticed that there is a stigma around shops with less than 5 star ratings, and a pressure for buyers to rate sellers 5 stars no matter what. I have seen many examples of buyers unknowingly giving a 4 star review that is often very kind and respectful and provides genuine helpful feedback for the seller to make their products better, just for the buyer to retaliate with a one star snarky review that greatly impacts the buyer’s own star ratings. As a seller myself, I geatly value feedback from my buyers and I know that many other sellers on depop feel the same way. As a buyer, I would like to give honest reviews that are helpful and constructive to the seller without fearing retaliation or punishment that would harm my own shop image. The best solution to this problem is either to remove the option for sellers to rate buyers, or to make all reviews completely anonymous. Personally, I would prefer both. Everyone likes having all five star reviews, but It’s unrealistic to foster an expectation that ALL shops maintain that kind of streak. Businesses grow and develop, and honest feedback is part of that. 

Hopefully this feedback is helpful. Overall, I’ve really enjoyed this app and I hope that it can continue to become better and be a great place for selling secondhand products !",False,2020-09-15 17:04:46,"{'id': 17935595, 'body': ""Hey.

3,rickyv2,It's great but... there are a few things,"Shipping cost needs to be put next to the price cause most of the times shipping isn't free and my cart is full with a billion things that I added just to see shipping because shipping cost definitely matters to the consumer and there is no reason why we shouldn't see it upfront. 
 A make an offer feature would also be wonderful, that can be declined or adjusted by the seller, or even disabled on certain items or the shop as a whole. 
 Not that this is too important but I should also be able to choose whether men's or woman's or both appears on my explore I have my sizes set to men's yet the majority of the clothes in explore are women's clothes, I get the majority of it is from the ""things we love category"" but I have no interest in woman's clothes. 
I would like to suggest that there is infinite scroll besides the search bar and explore. Sort of how on instagrams explore you click on a post and then can keep scrolling through that way I can consistently see larger pictures other than just thumbnails through the search bar or explore, because sometimes an item that I don't think looks good but then click on to see it larger is more appealing.
 Other than that great app I've only made one purchase so far but it's great just to look around and gather inspiration but -2 stars cause it's only average as of writing this review but I could change depending on the future of the app. I've got my friends to download the app and they all enjoy it as well but we have similar views on these features.

3,depopped??,Fees refund,"The site is ok but the advertisement fee they take out of Paypal (after deducting the fee from the original transaction on the receipt page!) seems a bit excessive. ESP when you see they have directions on how to refund the seller but then they don’t tell you that you need to directly contact depop (in the same article) to get your refund for the advert/sale. It’s like they WANT you to forget/ not realize that you are owed that money back should the sale not go through for any reason. wether it’s the buyer who wants a refund or the seller needs to cancel either way, you need to manually go in and refund them through Paypal and Depop isn’t linked and has no way of knowing unless you contact them directly with the info they require to refund the fees. Ie your UN, the customers UN, the original date of the sale, the amount of fees they charged you and a photo proving you provided the customer refund. So 6 things total. I’m still not clear if they keep the money they took out of the sale and we just get the advert fee back from Depop that came out of Paypal separately? 

I think the fees and refunds part is a bit shady in that respect incase you run into an issue like I did and need to reverse several sales for whatever reason you need to remember the fee you paid out directly to them at the time of the sale. So if you refund anyone for ANY reason be sure to contact them with the 6 pieces of info above so they can refund your fees bc it no where states they get to keep that if the sale doesn’t finalize. Also in some of my transactions they took out as much as 30% (or somewhere close) for an advert fee. $9 for a $30 sale not to mention the $3 they take out of the original bill. Also the receipts in the sold section where the label comes up it still says “leave feedback” so you are able to receive and leave feedback for cancelled sales. This is a bug they should have worked out long ago and they should be affiliated with Paypal so that we automatically get refunded fees and the sale stops showing on my feed. 

Other than that issue it’s an all around solid app. I just hate anything having to do with Paypal and wish they processed their own transactions like Mercari or poshmark.",False,2018-04-25 13:57:35,"{'id': 3269392, 'body': ""Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to write this. We agree that the fee refund process for users (and us!) is a little laborious at the moment. We're currently working with PayPal to understand whether there is a way to make this a more seamless experience, and we hope that you'll spot some improvements this year on that front. With regards to taking more than 10% as an advertising fee: it sounds like this is the shipping cost of an item you sold. As we can't take the money from the buyer, this is initially taken from the seller and then refunded to you. If you need a little more clarity on this, don't hesitate to contact our support team.

I've never really dealt with any horrible rude people, everyone's been very nice. I do have a problem with the explore page. I've been featured maybe three times but haven't in a really long time. The same people get featured; I was just scrolling through the explore page and the same girl was on there 5 times. I have updated all my items with try on photos since Depop says that's the best way to get featured/sell items. Some other things; 1)the delete button on photos when editing is super super difficult to click. I will press it a bunch of times right on the nose and it takes like ten taps for it to ask if I want to delete. 
2) PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM. I always do the shipping with USPS option and never the my own shipping. Idk how this happens, I saw another reviewer have the same issue, but when I go to edit an item, for some reason the items says I'm selling using my own shipping when I definitely DID NOT CHOOSE THAT. And when I go to change it it doesn't work. It only does when I restart the app. I just sold an item and do not have a shipping label because the shipping option was changed and I DID NOT CHANGE IT MYSELF

5,Nate Archer,Great! But need more brands!,"Highly recommend this app for any vintage clothing sellers, it’s a super easy platform to use, and one of my favorite features of the app is being able to mark things as sold instead of deleting the item if it sold on another selling platform. It takes the same percentage as EBay, but in my opinion it is a lot smoother of a design than eBay and is great for people who want a more curated environment to sell in.

I do have some critiques however:

1) PLEASE ADD MORE BRANDS, unlike other selling apps who have a great database of brand to chose from when you list an item, depop has only a few. For example, if I was to list a shirt from the 80s thats branded “Short Hills Tee” or “Sport-Tee”, I would have to chose a different brand instead of those because they don’t have such options, despite them being a very mass produced shirt. Same goes for other well known brands made today. Please add some more brand to chose from so I can have more specified listings!!

2) You can’t filter to see items that are already sold, even though you can see sold items on sellers pages. This part just doesn’t make sense to me logically. In every other selling app I’ve been on, there is always an option where you can filter though the sold and available items, in order to get an idea about how much the item your about to list will sell for on the platform, however this is not an option for Depop. I would highly suggest adding this feature, as it would help a lot of new buyers to be able to price there items accurately, instead of having to use another app’s resources to do so!

2,Tied Together With A Smile,Severe Spam and Transparency Issues,"I’ve been using Depop for a couple years and for the most part I’ve enjoyed it, most buyers/sellers are great, and I think Depop’s customer service is really wonderful, but the app has a lot of problems. As far as selling goes, the only issue I really have is the 4 photo limit for a listing. 4 photos definitely isn’t enough and it would be nice to see 8 photos allowed instead, like it is with most other apps. 

The issue with Depop mainly comes from buying. The app is absolutely FULL of spam. People will leave a giant paragraph of random keywords in their description boxes, most of which have nothing to do with the actual product they’re selling. So when you’re  searching for an item, the vast majority of items that come up in the search results have absolutely zero relation to what you were searching for. You have to spend ages combing through listings hoping to EVENTUALLY find something related to your search. And people frequently tag items as being brands they aren’t for “exposure”, so even if you select to search through a particular brand, a good portion of what comes up isn’t even that brand  either! 

 And while I hate that Depop allows drop shipping, the very least they could do is require transparency. People will frequently list drop shipping items as “handmade” or “vintage”, when they aren’t. Also, another issue is people aren’t informed about WHERE drop shipping items are coming from. The item location is where the SELLER is located. Not necessarily the item. So you could purchase an item thinking it’s coming from New York, then come to find out its being shipped from China. I think Depop definitely has strong points, and overall I’ve enjoyed selling on the app, but they just really need to find ways to cut down on spamming, and enforce some transparency guidelines.",False,2019-09-10 04:06:01,"{'id': 10627443, 'body': ""Hey. Thanks for the review. With regards to spam and brand spam, we've recently introduced some new listing requirements that will limit unnecessary tagging and spam.

2,Mia O'Neal,This is my 2nd review attempt to get yall’s attention,"Okay, so I’ve had an issue with my notifications on depop for the past 2 months. For some reason, I only get a notification if an item gets sold or my depop payments is notifying me of money that is going in the bank soon. I have all the notifications that I want set in the in app settings and obviously on my apple settings (since I get notified when an item gets sold). I never get notifications when someone messages me, which is really inconvenient now, and it has been like this for the past few months.. I’ve contacted you guys both in-app and through email and through instagram comments AND made a review to discuss my issue but I have still gotten NO response. Last time I made a review, your “developer commentator” seemed to respond almost right away, telling me to go in-app and try to request help there. But I have still have yet to have gotten help. I get that we’re in a pandemic and I get your platform isnt that big compared to Ebay, but at this point, it’s as if you guys have no customer service at all. Please invest more money in it because yall are clearly slacking in this area. Just as you guys say in your seller handbooks... “customer service is key.” So please reciprocate that same energy into your own practices... Rather than focusing on protecting your brand’s image through the app store in your developer comments, try actually helping the customers.

5,Hi my name is Ru,Some New Feature Ideas,"Depop is an amazing app and super easy to use. I’ve made plenty of sales and it’s definitely the platform that I’ve made the most profit off of. However, I believe that there should be more features to make the app even better.

First suggestion: be able to see the sold items while searching

I believe that this feature would be useful because from a seller perspective, it’s nice to see the price of items that are similar to the items you’re selling go for. It would give you a nice price range to know what price would be most ideal for what you’re selling - and would probably boost more sales too as sellers know what’s reasonable and what’s not. It may also help seller’s make more money by not pricing it too low either, so it’d be for the best on both spectrums.

Second suggestion: have “free/seller pays for shipping” as an option in the filters while searching

I believe that this particular feature would be useful because as a buyer, you like to know what the price is of the item prior with the shipping included in the original price. If you are on a budget and only are willing to pay a max price that includes shipping, this would be perfect. Too many times I’ve been browsing and found something I’ve wanted to buy, but found that it was $7 for shipping for a simple shirt. This would prevent this from happening by knowing whether or not shipping is already included within the price.

Thanks Depop team! I really appreciate how much you listen to the feedback your users give - it’s not something many apps do in this time of age.",False,2018-04-08 17:02:43,"{'id': 3074457, 'body': 'Hey Ru - this is great; we love reading reviews like this because they give us a great idea of what our community wants in future editions of the app. Thanks again!

5,psypris,buying & selling on DEPOP,"the app is great! overall, it’s a great community of people, there’s nice items to see, and there is plenty of fantastic sellers! 

BUYING EXPERIENCE: it’s very simple and nice. BUT, no seller is the same! some will be interactive with you and some will not message you at all. either way, you can easily message them on your concerns about your item(s). also, SOME sellers will not admit to damage of an item, so make sure you know the condition of your item before spending your money on it. For the most part, sellers are honest and will admit to anything about the item. Plus, many (not all) are willing to negotiate prices with you! 

SELLING EXPERIENCE: this process is simple, as well. You can choose to “ship with Depop” which is Depop setting the prices and making the label for you (which you have to print out somehow) and it’s all through USPS (unless you’re located in another country). You can also set your own shipping prices and create the label another way (i.e. Paypal). Setting your own prices can also include international shipping (if you desire to ship that way). I have been selling on Depop for a few months now and i’ve sold quite a bit of items. it’s fun because i love making packages for people and it makes me happy to know that i’m decluttering my closet! The things I have noticed: getting things going when it comes to selling (this process will be slow considering you’re new. you need to take nice pictures, set good/fair prices, and make your shop appealing), and some buyers will attempt to low ball you. now, if you’re okay with any price, be my guest! if not, do not let them low ball you because remember: it’s your items, your shop, and your rules! Once you get things going, you and the buyer can easily leave reviews for each other, and when you start shipping items out periodically (i.e. i ship almost every day), it will put on your profile an estimate of how fast you ship. My profile says “often ships in 1 day”. Overall, it’s been going great so far. ALSO*** Depop takes off a 10% fee from any purchase. For example: if you are selling a shirt for $10, you will receive $9 from that because it’s 10%. They take 10% off the total of the item(s), this does not include the final total with shipping! 

My advice is to be creative with photos and captions, give insane amounts of details (things you would like to know if you were the buyer), and be friendly! Make sure you’re doing what you like while having great customer service + ensuring your customer is happy! 

I hope this helps! Thank you again, Depop.",False,2020-01-02 21:51:29,"{'id': 12709959, 'body': ""Hey. Thanks for the feedback the comprehensive feedback!

The customer service and seller protection is god awful. Getting help from support is a complete joke and they will never, ever side with sellers that make them 1K in fees and up, but somehow they will choose to side with rude buyers that offer them nothing in terms of sale fees. I’m not the first and certainly not the last seller to be treated awfully by Depop customer support. They make it extremely difficult to contact them and purposely hide their customer service email so their agents can be the lazy people they are and avoid the many, many issues their customers want to discuss with them. They also purposely hide and censor comments that demonstrate their inconsistent policies. The development team purposely ignores and even belittles complaints about the app (crashes, bugs, algorithm changes that hurt big and small sellers). I’ve also seen so many top sellers get away with breaking rules while Depop goes after smaller accounts, it’s just so hypocritical. I’m only on the app because it’s the one platform that can cater to my style, but if a similar app came out without all the issues I’d move in a heartbeat.

5,chelseabethanne,"Nice, but some improvements would make it better...","This is one of the easiest apps to use for sellers and resellers. 

Improvements I’d like to see:

The ability to add more than 4 photos. Sellers can add a video to a listing, which is helpful in some instances, but additional photos would be great.

In-app photo editing. Switching between depop and editing apps to add text, etcetera, is time consuming. 

Having an “offer” option would increase sales. If a potential buyer wants to negotiate a price, the process is clunky. 

If a buyer could just click an offer option and make an offer (like poshmark and Mercari) instead of having to get in touch with the seller, wait to hear from the seller, maybe negotiate the price some more, wait to hear from the seller again, agree on a price, wait for the seller to adjust the listing to reflect the new terms, contact the buyer to let them know the listing has been adjusted, before a sale occurs.....whew!!! That takes a lot of time! An offer option would streamline that process a great deal.
 
Also, if a seller could set a minimum price (like eBay) when an offer is made, that’s at or above the minimum, the sale would automatically go through. That would speed transactions up a bit, too. 

There could be more space in the bio section. It would be nice to have more space for important information. Shop policies, personal environment (does the seller smoke or have cats or have cats that smoke?? for instance) need to be at the very top so there’s a better chance of a buyer knowing these things in advance. 

Overall, this is a nice platform for sellers with hopes for an even better interface in the near future.",False,2018-09-05 00:07:15,"{'id': 4950855, 'body': ""Hey Chelsea, \n\nThank you so much for the feedback!

5,Cassie Rey,Customer Service??,"Update: Issue resolved and my listing was put back up! 💛 Thank you for reading the reviews, very much a appreciated. I love depop! 

Although love this app better then all the other resale apps... I have had a few incidents with it. One, when I sell an item it doesn’t mark it sold that’s happened 3 times. Second, they removed an item and because of this 

I've had a look and it seems like this was removed due to improper item description.
We know it might be tempting to reference other brands like Chanel, Gucci, Supreme...etc in your item description, but this is improper use of trademarked brand names.

I did not improperly label or write in the description any misleading brands I had all the proper brands in the description as well as a picture of all of the tags on the items. They are not fake ties, they were actually my fathers. I emailed customer service and got that response above. I asked how I can repost without getting in trouble and having it removed again and wasn’t answered but told there was already a final answer to the inquiry. Not sure what to do about reposting still and not only that but it is a shame because I really love depop and want to continue using it. If I can’t trust their gonna remove things for no reason or strike my account even for that matter how could I use it freely as I was before. I have sold a lot of items on this app and have 41 reviews all 5 stars and great, if you look at all my descriptions I’m as honest and transparent as they come.

1,brick_86,Sellers don’t have to ship the item you bought!,"I bought some pants from a seller on this app and the moment I bought from them the seller immediately stopped responding. I didn’t think much of it until two weeks later and the pants still weren’t shipped. I tried to check up and make sure everything was cool, it wouldn’t have been the first time someone took that long to ship an item, but I don’t usually care how long it takes the seller as long as they keep me updated. This seller, however, did not. I attempted messaging them four other times, but I didn’t get a response, keep in mind that you can see the user’s activity on the app, and they were active. I gave up with them and tried to issue a refund through the app. Depop claimed to have buyers protection as long as you purchase items through the app, so I didn’t think it would be a problem to get my money back. I was wrong. I received an auto reply the moment I issued the refund and they said they’d get back to me via email. That never happened. I tried issuing a refund a second time to see if the outcome would be different somehow, but i found out that you can’t issue a refund on the same item twice, so I tried emailing Depop directly. That time they didn’t even bother to acknowledge my email. Turns out that I’m not the only person this seller has done this to. I went to give this seller an honest review to warn potential buyers, but for some reason that feature isn’t showing up for that item anymore, so basically you’re able to post items, have people buy them, keep the money and the item, and nothing will happen to you...

5,Partyofvolvpeople,Haterz plz. I only have one complaint.,"People get so mad about the explore page, it’s ridiculous. I have no problem with y’all featuring the same people multiple times. Guess what, if someone continues to post quality items with good images I LOVE that depop continues to support them and give them exposure. They deserve it. If the app saw an awesome item but refrained from sharing it via explore because the person already had followers, that would be silly. The point of the explore page is to feature sick items and sick shop owners regardless of their following. I also saw a few comments saying only “wannabe Instagram models” and “people who are already famous on insta” are the only people who can succeed on this app. That’s just not true. Depop gave me a platform to become more successful, and because of depop I’ve actually gained a following on instagram, not the other way around. 

This app is DA BOMB. I’m so thankful for this platform. The community is great and I love that they actually care about having a well crafted aesthetic, it makes it such an inspiring and fresh app to be a part of. This app has made me NEVER want to go on eBay/poshmark/any other apps because this app is just so much more user friendly and appealing to young adults and teens. 

If you use common sense, scamming is rare. Let’s face it, people: scamming can happen on ANY selling platform. That’s just what happens when you’re working with people. Some are good and honest, others aren’t. If you’re afraid of being scammed, ONLY buy from sellers you trust, ones that have good reviews and a solid reputation. There are PLENTY of shops like that on depop. 

My one complaint is that I do agree with the fee, it’s ridiculous that they take 10% from the item price AND the shipping price. They should not be able to take a percentage of the shipping money..that money is TO SHIP THE ITEM. 

Anyway, thanks for creating a great selling platform and a space to make your own shop and become a boss all by yourself, depop!",False,2017-11-12 00:05:58,

4,polaar beaar,could use some improvements,"overall this app is solid for vintaging clothing. however there’s a few improvements that could be made. 
1. the new “DNA” section of the app- i was excited to see this because i thought it had meant that the depop algorithm had changed. not the case. i’m still getting the same overpriced brandy tank tops, bodycon dresses, and used checkboard vans that i did before. It doesn’t make sense that the algorithm is supposed to be based off of what you like/save, because i never like or save anything close to those. i feel like depop could get a lot more $$$ as a company if they worked on improving their algorithm so buyers wouldn’t have to go through heaps of garbage to find one good item. also, the “for you”/DNA section doesn’t update regularly, which is kinda annoying. 
2. speaking of which ... misuse of tags/keywords- this is a huge one for me, although idk how depop could fix it. but it is the most frustrating thing to look up “cottagecore” or “vintage 70s” and find stuff no where CLOSE to those. there should be some way to prevent this, maybe by limiting the amount of keywords people can use? idk it’s just super annoying, because sometimes i’m not exactly looking for a specific item, more so just wanting to find style inspo. 
3. overpricing etc- this is a common frustrating that i feel like no one can really fix bc it’s not depops fault, it’s just kinda how the free market works unfortunately. but maybe for pieces claiming to be vintage, the seller should be required or encouraged to post a pic of the tag? because that’s the most telling sign that something’s vintage. idk! it just might help.

1,me ?¿,Was good then turned bad.,"Was a seller for 2 years on there and recently my account was taken down because i posted a warning about a scammer. Ontop of that even saying the word “paypal” gets you banned, yet this site runs through paypal. Doesn’t make much sense. After i got the warning i changed my listings but still got banned. Also, I could not report the person properly because the options did not fit what i needed to report. Maybe add an other button with an explanation box. Tried emailing the team, and as always no response. I have reported people who never get taken down or never get an email saying that something was done about my report. Also can we talk about the fees? You guys took 12$ out of the total when that was literally the amount needed to ship. I lost money by posting it! That’s why everyone wants to go through paypal goods and services because you guys take WAY too much! Buying can be okay but i seriously don’t think you should allow people to resell USED LINGERIE. Do you guys realize the risk that is? I think you should go through listings more because people can catch stds from that! If it’s not new lingerie unused don’t let people resell! Disappointed as hell now, i love using it to buy stuff, but often on hashtags its cluttered with stuff that has nothing to do with the hashtag. I do report it but again, nothing ever comes out of it. I used to recommend Depop to everyone. Now I say to steer away from it as a seller. Multiple emails sent after they say “Go ahead send another one” and still no response. This was happening before the panademic too might i add, so thats no excuse. I think something else you guys should consider is if you delete a user who bought something from someone, now there’s NO WAY to contact that seller! I don’t know if i’m getting the stuff i ordered or not!

1,Journalist T,Depop Ruined My Only Source Of Income,"Hey! I just want to say Depop is an amazing app! The best app to sell your items and buy as well! Personally I’ve never sold any of my items on another platform, only Depop. The community is fantastic and not only that but how they format the app is astonishing. I’m a journalist at my school and I write articles about fashion and shopping. A couple weeks ago I decided to write an article about online shopping! I didn’t write about Urban Outfitters, GRAILED, or SHEIN. I decided to write about Depop because I love what they are doing and how they encourage you to sell the cloth you don’t use so it won’t go to waste. I wrote how before this epidemic I sold on Depop as my only source of income. It help me a lot to my day to day life. After the article was written I got a lot of feedback! Many of my fellow students and friends love the app and started to buy and sell. As well as family members started to use the app. UNFORTUNATELY! SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED TO ME! A couple days ago I went on Depop and I was log out. But how?!? I didn’t log myself out nor did anything like that. I went on my email to see if there was a reason they did that. There was nothing! And I checked on the App Store if it needed an update and nothing! After a couple of days I decided to contact their customer service. They got back to me after a day or two and to my amazement they said they deleted my account for violating their terms and service. From my memory I did no such thing! I have all five star ratings, great seller, and no customer didn’t have a problem with me. Then I decided to ask what terms and services I violated and they said I was using another account and that account violated my terms and services. As well I only have one account! I’ve never had another Depop account! They mentioned some name I’ve never heard of and supposedly that was me! Me! I said I was never associated with that user and not sure how they see contacted to me. The customer service seemed to ignore what I said and they still said that I’m not allowed to have another account and I violated their terms and services (And I want to say that they NEVER I MEAN NEVER sent me an email for why they deleted my account and didn’t mention anything). I was lost with words and I was worried that the customers that I sold to weren’t going to have the ability to contact me. I sold 3 items a couple days before this happened and now am I supposed to have contact with them?!! As well I bought one thing and now am I supposed to know the shipping number or have contact with them if anything is wrong about the package! A lot was going through my head but especially how my business was ruined. I’ve spend so much time to get where I was and all those ratings for nothing! To see it get deleted. Now I have no source of income and all the jobs I’ve applied to said they don’t need new employees. Depop ruined my only source of income. All that time I put into the app was all gone! And I’ve never had any other Depop account besides mine! For my last article I’m going to write about this incident and have my title as the same as the review. Say why you should be carful and how the customer service isn’t helpful at all! And they confuse you with other users. This is just horrible and I never thought this would happen to me. All the time I put into it and I gave the Depop community back with money with the commission they got. Sadly I’m disappointed with you guys and you lost a trusted seller.

1,Vansss12453,Suspends accounts and gives little to no reason for it,I’ve had my account for more than a year now and I was getting steady following and had 21 5 star reviews nothing serious but it was still something to be happy about. Always treated everyone with kindness and respect but out of nowhere I get a temporary suspension notice for abusive behavior which I’ve never done before. The email said I could appeal it in 3 days yet I had to wait 5 days for just a response to why I got the suspension. During that time I was emailed at least 15 times asking for an explanation and never getting an answer just the same automated customer service blah blah. The final response was that they weren’t even going to let me appeal it because I somehow threatened someone on depop. What kind of customer support is this where they don’t even investigate anything they just take someone’s word for it and destroy the other persons account for no reason. I have no idea where depop got that reasoning from it honestly never happened and I’m still baffled as to how they just permanently banned me for something that never happened and made me wait 5 days to tell me this. Truly the worst place to sell items at. If you’re hoping to find a good app that values customers and has your back don’t go here they delete your account for no reason and tell you it’s your problem afterward. Also there’s big accounts that literally scam people and don’t send out orders and steal from people and depop does nothing about it but when someone doesn’t like the prices you’re putting out for your items and puts up Faldo claims towards you you’re automatically shut out. Customer support is laughable I don’t know how they hire them but you can see how much they don’t care by their responses and attitudes if they even respond at all.,False,2020-10-06 02:35:31,"{'id': 18359392, 'body': ""Hey there,\n\nWe’re sorry to hear your experience hasn't gone to plan.

1,JoyDestroy,"Garbage customer service, shady employees","Let me start by saying that I’ve been selling on this app for several years, I have 25K followers and all positive feedback. I sell vintage clothing, and recently they’ve been removing some of my items for no apparent reason. I tried contacting them several times and got to response. Finally a few days ago someone responded saying my images didn’t belong to me, which they do because I took them myself. I explained that to them and asked them to have someone else look into it and reactive my listings bc obviously there’s an issue with their system or someone is reporting me and therefore they need to do something about it. they completely ignored what I was saying and just forwarded me a list of their community guidelines, then stopped responding. I am so beyond frustrated and blown away that they literally have no respect or care to help resolve an issue for someone who makes them thousands of dollars. I also contacted them a few days ago to get my depop shipping fee refunded to me as I had to purchase my own shipping label since wherever someone makes a bundle purchase and one or more of the items is shipping with their labels, it always ends up weighing more and therefore you can’t use the provided label. They got back to me right away asking for proof of purchase and my email, both of which had already been provided with my initial request. I provided the info again and now it’s been 3 days and still no refund or response...Their customer service is absolute garbage and if things don’t start improving I will be closing my shop and taking my business elsewhere. also if you don’t like being constantly bombarded with low offers and people wanting to trade then you probably should sell on this app.",False,2020-07-24 00:47:33,"{'id': 16937714, 'body': ""Hey, we’re sorry to hear your experience hasn't gone to plan.

4,Balonii1,It’s alright so far,"I’ve been using this app for about three days, just as a beginner and testing out the waters... first thing first I wish they didn’t have to go through just PayPal, I wish they had more options with how to transfer money such as; cash app, or Venmo. My PayPal is the biggest issue I’ve dealt with. Not everyone is comfortable with going by just one alternative to receive their money especially if they’re not familiar with it. 

Second, I do see that there’s a certain aesthetic to this app, almost everyone or (at least the items I’ve seen,) has a certain photo quality, or the way people look to advertise their clothing. it’s almost like Instagram, but selling items. People and their “feeds,” I guess, just reminds me of all the famous people on Instagram, the explore page looks saturated and condensed

Lastly, they do want you to sell your items! Which is a good thing. I’ve used offer up for almost 1.5 years. Offer up takes awhile, you can accept or decline someone’s offer on the spot, and some people are spotty. With this app, when someone buys something, it notifies you right away having you feel like you have to pack your item right away and ship it off! I’ve already sold 3 things on here with the amount of time I’ve only been using this app. However, I wish depop could take less of a percentage, there’s already so much fees (bank transfer fees, shipping fee, depop fee,) I’m sometimes split if I do make money or not because I don’t actually know how much I should charge for shipping on my listings. 

Recap (for depop); please have more diversity on the explore page and feature more people with not just the same aesthetic, reconsider going through different banking apps to work with, and lower fees!

1,nerdcake,Basically lied to and dubbed by Team Depop,"I love depop and I’ve net-totaled over $600 already from my first month jumping back on, but I’ve received a ticket today from Team Depop warning me about me violating rules of posting electronics and I explained I haven’t sold any electronics at all since I started and all the times they’ve removed my listings have been misconducted then so I was wondering if any history of this can be undone because they basically threaten closure of my account if i “break” their rules again but all they replied with was “Check out our community guidelines.” I now will just use the app until they permaban me for no valid reason i guess? it’s very disheartening.

you guys are just lying again and again because I’ve sent 3 replies to that email thread and have been ignored each time. and you absolutely can not say “deep investigation and consideration” since you clearly tried to claim I was selling electronics, and I WAS NOT SELLING ANYTHING ELECTRIC AT ALL! Please, your generic reply just honestly makes things even worse. And I know I’m not the only one with issues of items being removed and being threatened suspension for invalid reasons, just look on reddit.

1,l..x..r,Poor user culture and customer service,"I’ve been using the Depop app for years and in the beginning it was great to use as it was easy to post items and set prices. The app was also relatively new at the time! Yet for the last year the user culture has really deteriorated the experience. This includes scammers that are both buyers and sellers. On the seller end some never ship out their items or sell counterfeit items. On the buyers end they state their item never arrive especially if they are small items and are shipped through usps. Buyers also tend to send spam messages about items to either make purchases outside of Depop, continuously ask about when the item is shipped if it isn’t shipped within a day, or ask many questions throughout the course of a week and yet not purchase the item because they “don’t have the money right now” essentially wasting sellers time. Disputes are also not handled through Depop and must be completed through PayPal which have no connection through Depop sales or individual store policies. Although I have been an avid Depop user my store has also not grown much albeit avid posting, selling, reviewing and purchasing. I can see that those who work on the app continue to promote and praise bigger/ more popular sellers as that’s where they obtain the most revenue while leaving smaller stores behind. Due to all of   reasons I will not be returning to this app or promoting it whatsoever. There is minimal regulation of a variety of problems that have been building up over the years. They are more focused on monetary gain than the user experience!! Beware!",False,2019-10-09 18:58:52,

1,eunhae kim,depop doesn’t care about sellers,"i have been selling on depop for around 2 years, consistently only a little under one year. depop was a lifestyle and it had saved my life. i cleared out a whole room in my house to make my little depop warehouse. i received the email that said i was one more month from being a top seller and receiving the blue check mark and getting an account manager. i woke up every morning, thinking of ways to improve my shop, it was the first and last thing i checked on my phone, always before imessages or any other social media. i wrote a five star review a few months back saying how depop saved my life and they said it was the best review they’d received and “we got you boo.” well turns out you really don’t. i went through a huge learning experience when i was messaging a girl in my depop messages and turned the conversation personal, telling her to “shut up.” it’s probably one of the lowest points i’ve ever reached and i know that i would never do anything like that again. yet depop permanently banned my account because of it with no chance to appeal. the thing that o have dedicated my entire life to, was going to move to Los Angeles to get a job at the Depop office, everything I’ve been working towards. gone down the drain because of a silly dm, that i could have made right, had i gotten the chance. i have never been so lost in life and confused and disappointed and after dedicating so much time to something, i have to reinvent my career path and choices and depop has absolutely no remorse.",False,2019-08-23 22:20:49,"{'id': 10374384, 'body': ""Hey - we've reached out to you via email to follow up with this.

1,appleuser456,NO BUYERS PROTECTION!!,"I used Depop for about 5 months and had a great overall experience the whole time until I encountered my first shady seller. I always read reviews of accounts before I make a purchase to ensure other people have had good experiences purchasing through that seller. This account had all positive reviews so I didn’t think twice about the purchase. Before you know it, 9 weeks go by I hadn’t received anything. I messaged the seller numerous times and they never responded. I tried to be so understanding/patient and hoped there was just a delay, but I issued a report to Depop and they didn’t do sh+t and the seller deactivated her PayPal account and my receipt never came up through PayPal, but she definitely took my money. I had to call my bank personally and it was really just a ridiculous process. I left a review on that account saying “Never received my package be careful with this seller she’s a scam,” and so many other people started reaching out to me with the same issue asking how I got a refund because Depop wasn’t doing sh+t to help them either. That in itself is pathetic because Depop should be helping them not me. Of course I didn’t mind helping them out at all, but there’s clearly an issue if people can’t even go to Depop to resolve their Depop problems. I’ve also been reading the reviews of this app and so many other people have expressed the same concern and Depop doesn’t care to actually do something about it. They make up the same claim that their process works and they don’t need to change it and it’s safer blah blah, but NO. They’re just freaking lazy and they don’t want to have to deal with buyers protection cuz they just want to protect themselves and save their own money and watch them not even respond to this because they know I’m right. And after all that, I tried to let it go and make another purchase after everything settled down and the same thing happened. And what did Depop do to help the situation? Nothing. You have to request your payment back through PayPal which obviously if they’re scamming you they’re not going to pay you back. I didn’t even call my bank because I felt embarrassed after I literally just dealt with the same sh+t so I literally lost $80. I know this is so long, but I’m really sick of Depop sitting here and doing nothing to offer buyers protection. Love the concept, but unfortunately they don’t care about their customers.",False,2020-09-02 11:39:10,"{'id': 17690561, 'body': ""Hey, we’re sorry to hear your experience hasn't gone to plan.

1,workinginteraction8,WORST CUSTOMER HELP EVER,"I’ve loved using Depop for the past year as both a seller and a buyer. When transactions between the seller and buyer are smooth, this app works okay and the interface is constantly improving. However, as soon as you run into a problem (i.e. seller does not send you the item, there is problem with payment, etc.), Depop Help is an absolute nightmare to deal with. If you reach out to them for help, they will give verbatim responses that are not specific to what you are asking or they won’t respond at all. After a month of paying and not receiving my item and going back and forth with Depop Help, I reached out to them again and asked for a refund. After a week, they did not respond and I filed a claim with my bank. It was only after I filed a claim that they finally reached out, offering a refund, and asked that next time, I try to resolve it with them before I file a dispute.......which is what I was trying to do for the past month with no response on their part. They asked for me to close the dispute before I can get a refund and threatened to take action against my account if I do not,  even though I’ve tried my best to resolve this in-house as peacefully and smoothly as possible. Depop Help has not been reliable or consistent in any of my interactions throughout this whole dragged out ordeal so it’s hard for me to trust their word and close the dispute since they might refuse to refund me in the end and then I would have lost the money that I paid and the item that I paid for.",False,2020-07-31 15:01:27,"{'id': 17287299, 'body': ""\nHey.

3,BJoanneArn97,Could use some improvements,"Overall, the app is wonderful! There are a lot of reasons to use this app over many other online thrift stores. But some things that I don’t like about the app are as followed:
1. Setting sizes- you can save your sizes in your profile, but 9 times out of 10 it doesn’t carry over as a filter while browsing added items. That’s in searches, Picked For You, and Things We Love.  Every now and then it does, but it gets really annoying FAST when every time you want to view a different category of clothing you have to set the sizes again.
2. Setting prices- this is almost the same as the size settings. There’s no option in settings to set your max price or anything, which is very normal and fine! But when browsing through the Picked For You, you can’t set a price. You can set this in other spaces, but most of the time it won’t set the filter and continues to show every item. 
3. Sold items- items that are sold are constantly still displayed in all categories. I understand that the listings will stay on the website, but often I’ll view very specific items and they’re already sold, which gives me no point in saving them. There should be an algorithm that removes them from general searches, or allows you to choose “available items”, “all items”, or “sold items” tabs in filters. 

These are my only issues that I have with the app, but these things are very important to me and over time I feel the usability has actually decreased, which is my reason for three stars. I still very much enjoy using the app and will continue doing so, but these fixes would make the buyer experience much better!",False,2020-07-22 21:55:59,"{'id': 16866377, 'body': ""\nHey.

1,unhappydepopuser200000,Worst customer service ever,"I swear I’ve never talked to more robotic people in my entire life. Their responses aren’t genuine or personalized at all, I sent an email about a refund I had to send and how it finally worked but my account was negative because of them charging their fees and she had some sort of nerve asking for screenshots I had already sent in a previous email and ended it with some sort of emote which I felt was inappropriate for the situation. The customer service is so bad I swear don’t even bother with them they don’t want to help you. On top of that I got several emails saying my items would be taken down and they NEVER WERE which is what started my issue in the first place. The girl bought an item that I had sold to a friend in person and I hadn’t taken it off Depop because I assumed that their email was correct and they had removed my items. Well they didn’t and she bought it and I had to go through the embarrassment of explaining that I needed to refund her for her money. After MULTIPLE days of playing tag with PayPal and Depop I finally managed to get the poor girl her money back, but now my PayPal balance is negative $23 for ‘advertising’ fees and I don’t have money to cover that. How’s that fair Depop? Contacting your customer service is a dead end because they keep asking me for the same information I’ve already sent and I’m sick and tired of dealing with your company at this point. It’s a wonder you stay afloat with your horrid customer service. I’m done here. The second I get that refund my account is getting shut down.",False,2018-08-09 08:04:49,"{'id': 4754656, 'body': 'Hi there - if this issue is yet to be resolved could you please update this review to include your Depop @username so we can better understand what we can do to help?

1,bluhammok,Employees are monsters,"Depop is a nightmare. I literally have trauma from their employees terrorizing me over a period of 2 years. I joined when it first became available in the US. They had US employees. It was laidback and easygoing. They would warn you if you went against their terms so you could fix it. It felt like a community. I used to post tutorials to help new sellers learn how to ship items. Then they fired their US teams and the UK employees took over. One decided she didn’t like me for some reason. She kept mass deleting my items and closing my account. I would have to email over and over and over until finally someone else would read it and fix it. I never once got an apology. Potentially buyers would be really wary of me, obviously. I would finally get a few sales, and they would do it again. I would have to refund my sales. Paypal doesn’t refund fees, so I LOST money. Actual money that was mine to Depop. I told them every single time that I am disabled and literally survive on what I make online. I went without food and suffered serious psychological trauma because some horrible employee in London decided that she didn’t like me. If you think it’s easy to get help as a disabled person, you are clearly not disabled. I relied on my depop sales to survive, they knew that, yet they kept attacking me, gaslighting me, defending their bully of an employee. I would gave sued, had I been heathy enough. I spoke to a lawyer and I had grounds because I had an agreement with them that she wouldn’t be allowed to mess with me anymore, but they kept doing it. They know exactly what they did, but never apologized, never offered any sort of compensation or gave my account back. All they do is twist the facts and keep getting my reviews removed. I have all the emails with them clearly lying about what I said when my message is right there. That’s gaslighting, which is abuse. This company is absolutely shameless. If they were decent people, they would have reprimanded their employee and made things right with me. They reply to my reviews but refuse to reply to my emails, 2 years after the last time, so this is what, 4 years total now? There are many other apps out there now, thankfully; try one of those instead. These are bad people, plain and simple.",False,2020-12-17 12:15:26,

1,Jleigh1999,Need ACTUAL buyer protection,"I made a purchase through this app after looking for another poshmark/mercari. I didn’t realize how much weight is shifted in the sellers side. The seller I dealt with was selling name brand knockoffs, then tucking it into the description *not said name brand. I messaged seller 2 mins after purchasing & explained this was my first purchase & I didn’t realize they were dupes until purchased. They take over a day to respond to messages (multiple times) & told me “you can resell it” which basically means to me: you accidently bought a knockoff & i finally got it off my hands so it’s on you now. In reality, these will never be sold because there’s a ridiculous amount of knockoffs of this specific product I can’t even tell if half the products are real (unless they come with tags). It’s ridiculous the sellers are allowed to put the Brand as the brand they’re impersonating, then hide in the bottom of the description *not (brand), then on top of it buyers have 0 protection for not understanding that selling knockoffs of name brands & making the brand as the description tag is allowed & losing money because of it. Poshmark offers a BUYER PROTECTION which allows the buyer to cancel/ with hold payment, & it actually protects both parties. Depop’s “buyer protection” seems to be unless it’s a complete lie of what the product was described as & what comes, you’re stuck with whatever you bought because you screwed up & we will not help you. This is awful, & there’s 0 buyer protection here. I’m also getting two completely different stories from their help on twitter & help on email. Help on twitter says to open a paypal dispute for counterfeit merchandise & email just says i’m stuck with it. How easy would it be to just put a middle barrier to let buyers cancel for a short period of time. Really? It was 2 mins before I realized it was a dupe product & now i’ve lost $30 I won’t get back. I will be deleting this app & not recommending it because of this purchase, the difficulty of the app & this entire experience.

3,SpaceLoser,Needs improvement,"I’ve been selling on this app for over 3 years and I’ve done fairly well when it comes to selling on this app. However, over the years I felt that this app needed some room for improvement and I hope they consider this review and others to make some changes in the next update. 

1.) There seems to be a glitch that still hasn’t been resolved yet. There’s some reviews I have that I can’t seem to leave a review for them. Yet it still pops up the notifications for them. It’s a little annoying and I really want to get this fix because I know I’m not the only one that has this problem.

2.) I’ve seen this complaint roll around in the reviews and it’s about the explore page. I too keep seeing the same old people popping up on the same page. It would be really great if we can start seeing new people every day instead of the same people we always see.

3.) I think Depop should start doing what Mercari is doing where a user buys something from you and you don’t receive the payment until the user confirms the item has arrived (and if they don’t confirm soon the app automatically gives you payment after a few days). I think it can help protect some users from scammers and users who delete their pages after the purchase is made. Also protecting from false claims but that’s just my thought. 

4.) Depop really needs to start busting through these scammers that are on the site. There’s too many of them and it’s very discouraging for future sellers/buyers to use the app. 

Overall, I think it’s a nice app but there’s always room for improvement and I hope Depop takes consideration to these reviews and help fix the problems it keeps having.",False,2018-04-26 06:15:50,"{'id': 3315563, 'body': ""Hey there - thank you so much for taking the time to leave this review.

1,nota90shipsterbbyorurbanhottie,Explore Page Trash,"I’ve had many successful and fruitful transactions on Depop. My fellow sellers and buyers are pleasant to interact with, and very diverse! BUT, the Depop team itself does not value true diversity. If you are not a half naked woman or your items do not fit into their very unique aesthetic (90’s hipster baby meets Urban hottie), you will not get featured. The same people get featured over and over again. A lot of beautiful items go unnoticed because the same wannabe instamodels are shown repeatedly. I am more upset about this than any other annoying glitch or scammer- and Depop has MANY of those as well. A few improvement suggestions: — make the follow limit the same fore EVERYONE. Why are some people able to follow 500k+ and others can only follow 7500? - We should be able to filter out sellers from other countries. So much spam! - Take notes from Poshmark. If an item isn’t shipped in a reasonable amount of time, the sale should be reversed. -Depop commission should be taken out of the item price, not shipping! Please do more to make buyers and sellers respect each other and be efficient. When I first discovered Depop I truly thought it had what it takes to LAST and beat out the other shopping apps, but I really doubt that now because it’s problems are deeper than tech. This is the MySpace of shopping apps, take that how you may. Many wonderful things, but can you depend on it? No. Depop has no problem bringing in users, but keeping them? Not so much.

4,cass🕯✨,Seller since 2015,"Pros
-Fee free and free shipping promotions. These really help when selling big ticket items. They could be longer or more strategically placed, such as during the first Friday of the month when many people have just received paychecks and have money to spend.

-Upcycling culture, where choosing second hand clothing over new clothing helps reduce waste and pollution.

-Each seller’s “brand” / style can be showcased well. Tags, filters, and subcategories make it easier for buyers to find what you’re selling.

Cons
-10% seller fee deducted by Depop, and 2.9% + $0.30 deducted by mandatory use of PayPal. So if I sell a $10 item, I only make $8.61. If I’ve offered free shipping to entice buyers, I’ve only made about $4. Depop, implement use of an app like Venmo, which has no fees, and generate your own buyer protection.

-If I want to arrange a payment to a seller via PayPal’s non-fee Friends and Family so they can afford to eat, I don’t want to risk consequences for this action.

-Featuring the same sellers, re-featuring the same items

Suggestions:

-Make a rearranging function available through the app, not just on the website.

-Reduce seller fees and offer free shipping more often / at better times.

-Offer sellers a chance to respond publicly to poor reviews, or contest / remove inaccurate ones.

-Implement use of / offer option of using an app like Venmo, which has no fees.

-Generate your own buyer protection.

Depop: Understand who your target audience is, and understand that many of us are young and using this app as a way to feed ourselves, pay off student loan debt, afford college, afford a car so we can hold down a job, or use this app on top of working a job / jobs.

3,Emmy! 😊,Love/Hate - User for 4+ years,"I’ve been using Depop for years, and with the recent design update, I’ve finally decided to leave a detailed review. I never felt like I needed to before, because the problems that I faced were easy to deal with/resolved quickly; but now I have a bit of a bone to pick with Depop.
For those wondering, I have an iPhone 5s that’s updated to the latest iOS and I have the newest version of Depop. 
Issues: 

-  I used to spend hours diving into the app and finding so much stuff. Now the app crashes when I just explore it for about ten minutes or so. (UPDATE: this is still an issue after several months.)
-  This may come off as a personal issue, but it’s been bothering me more and more over the years. The “explore” page caters mainly to one sort of style, which is Y2k, vintage “high” fashion, sporty, etc. It’s cool and all, but I wish the explore page could represent the app as a whole instead of just the more so top sellers who sell the same styles. I’ve decided to only use Depop to sell anything “aesthetic” and use other apps for more “normal” products.
-  This is what I’m the most annoyed with: they took away the activity page??? I used to LOVE seeing what people I followed liked because it helped me find shops similar to those that I followed. Also, a LOT of my activity used to come from that page. If someone liked something of mine, it’d create a chain reaction of people checking out the item/my shop so I’d get more activity, including more sales. 
-  Sometimes when looking through items on certain pages, such as likes, it won’t show something as sold until I click on it to see that it’s marked as sold under the photo? This makes exploring the app a lot more annoying and difficult.
-  My feee doesn't usually update when I add/change listings so I have to cancel out of the app for it to refresh. And, I guess it’s because I’m still using a 5s, but trying to refresh my profile is SUCH a hassle. (UPDATE: the added “filter” tab on my profile now makes it COMPLETELY impossible for me to refresh my page! Now I have to completely cancel out of the app to refresh my page!) You have to pull down on the bottom third of your screen, and my phone is too small for me to accurately pull it down far enough for it to refresh. PLEASE move the refresh to the top of the profile!
-  (UPDATE: I recently painted my walls off-white and now take all product photos in front of it. I’ve now been on the explore page several times and sold nine items in less than a month!) Sales aren’t up as much as they used to be. I’ve used this app off and on since 2013ish but nowadays, it’s much harder to sell things. I don’t know if it’s just that less people are using it, or there are less people looking to actually purchase through the app (due to no interest/users being afraid to because of all of the scams that’ve happened) but the only shops I see getting huge sale numbers are the few that are hyped by Depop. The more you list, the more you’ll sell, so if you plan on only selling a few things at first, it’ll take a long time to build up a shop. 
-  I can write an essay about how much I don’t like the look/feel of this app. I can speak volumes about how much I LOVED the past UI. I personally don’t like the direction that the app is going because, again, I think they’re only catering to specific styles/aesthetics with this update. I’m looking at it right now and it just doesn’t sit right with me and it kinda turns me off from using it sometimes. I’ll just say, it’s pretty blocky and it doesn’t look/work right on the small screen of my 5s. 
-  I personally feel like there should be a “policies” page on the profile, like the “likes” page. After all these years of us trying to fit our policies in our bio or trying to keep a policies listing at the top of our profile, I’d love for there to be an update that adds a policies page! It could even have the policies pop up when someone hits “buy” right before they make the purchase. I think that would help TREMENDOUSLY with the misunderstandings/confusion that occurs during some sales. Some buyers seem to just refuse looking for policies before purchasing, leading to some angry reviews. 
-  Fees are high, but it’s expected. DON'T sell though G&S to avoid this. It isn't worth it.

Pros: 
-  It’s a reliable app for selling (when done right) and it’s so easy to post things for sale! The community is a lot more inviting than other apps and it’s not as frustrating as selling on eBay, where you never know who you’re selling to until it’s too late. The community on Depop is mostly people who are buyers as well as sellers, so there’s a lot of understanding between sellers and buyers. 
-  The company is very helpful. I’ve yet to have to open a case with them, but I can tell they do their best to fix issues, though they can’t fix ALL problems. They’ve always been quick to respond to me! 
-  I don’t know... I’ve never gotten into the other selling apps. They had way too many confusing features/confusing interfaces/mean people that would always turn me away from using them. Depop is SO straightforward and you get your money RIGHT away. That means you can charge buyers an accurate shipping price depending on the item and it gives you the flexibility to ship your own way. 
-  It’s perfect for established shops as well as people just selling straight out of their closet! 
-  The shipping labels that you can make within the app are actually very useful! I personally make and print my own, but they’re useful for those who need them. They’re especially good for when you have something heavy to ship. 

I would recommend Depop to anyone looking to sell online, despite it’s issues. It’s the best selling app by far—app-wise and community-wise.",False,2018-03-23 14:15:29,

3,KoolNicole,"Getting better, but needs some work","I’ve been an avid seller on Depop (and also a buyer) for around 3-4 years now. Now I see ads for Depop on multiple platforms, trying to get more people to use the app. However, I feel that Depop isn’t ready for an influx of new users and should fix the current problems it has; sellers have been waiting for a solution!
1. Safety
Recently this has been a BIG issue where many accounts, including mine, were hacked into. The hackers tried to promote their own items and selling outside the app so they could scam buyers. This is a huge blow to both Depop and the reputation of my shop! Security needs an upgrade, 3rd party authorization could have prevented this.
2. Shipping
While they tried to fix the cost of shipping, prices are still abnormally high. $6.50 for 1lb? Mercari will ship it for you for $4.99 with the same carrier USPS. 
3. Bundles
BUNDLES NEED A FIX!!! Not sure what the point of the “free shipping on all bundles” option is when you lose money most of the time. Have us record the actual weight of the item in oz, etc. so that you can calculate the total weight of the items in a bundle at checkout instead of overcharging for shipping weight we don’t use. Also, add an option to disable purchases that guarantee you losing money; It’s disappointing to get a bundle purchase only to look and see that a $9 item was added when shipping is $14 somehow (and I could probably ship for $7 on my own!). Plus, Depop doesn’t subtract shipping fees on bundles when they take out their 10% fee, so while Depop isn’t losing money you, the seller, are. Yikes.
4. Customer Service
This is a HUGE one. If you don’t have an adequate customer service team, you can’t handle a surge of new users!! Recently MANY accounts were hacked and I was unable to get my account back after a full week. A phone line where you can speak to someone would be great for emergencies. Also, I’ve had several technical issues on Depop’s end that have taken way too long to resolve with Depop’s customer service team. I have never dealt with a company that takes a week to fix something, it’s usually the same day!
5. Dropshipping
Another issue that they have tried to address (thank you for that!) but that has not been anywhere near resolved. I still see the same volume of dropshipped listings (items you can get from Aliexpress for $2 being sold for $20). I feel like it would be beneficial to have a team manually go through and remove these listings.
Not sure if writing this review will change anything but I guess I have to try! Love the uniqueness of this app but I have been getting better results with other websites and will probably make the switch soon.

3,sweetacidiic,i love this app but needs improvement,"i love depop & its the only app i use to sell & buy from other sellers, its the best place to find things i actually like. the only thing about depop which most people dont mention & neither do depop themselves is they always charge after your money is sent to paypal & i was never told they would, i never get the amount of money i even sell something for ever bc depop takes out of it and its frustrating. where does that money even go to & why do you take it? first its a depop fee then an automatic payment which is usually always $4-$6 and if it's something more expensive its $10 like what am i paying you for? using your shipping? idk if that applies to the people who use their own shipping but i like using depops shipping to save me the trouble of making my own labels unless depop gives you a label when you use your own shipping too. thats another thing, i wish they could tell us about that too, how both shipping works & if they make the labels for us whether its our own shipping or theirs. theres a lot of things depop doesnt inform us about that i wish they could bc i end up finding it out on my own and getting frustrated about it. depop is the best selling app out there for me but this just makes me mad, i wouldnt use any other app bc i can find anything to my liking on depop and ive just used it for so long but selling is just the worst on this app. i hate not making full profit for my sales, like whats the point of it then. i can sell something for $5 & like $3.50 shipping and then just only get $3 out of it, im not just speaking theoretically either, this has happened. so if you plan on still taking money from us sellers like this depop, at least inform people before they start selling. i would also like to know why it's even being taken, i thought apps got their profit by being promoted, advertised & from their amount of users, & yall have enough of that, so whats the extra money taken from sellers for?",False,2020-07-23 15:49:09,"{'id': 16866873, 'body': ""Hey, thanks for the review.

3,Mai Fayre,great community but algorithm works against smaller shops,"I’ve only been on depop for a year or so, and while some things have changed for the better (now you can save drafts for items you haven’t posted yet, limited hashtag feature & video posts), the algorithm still somehow gets worse. Many of my items don’t show up in search results even after scrolling to the very end which is a complaint I’ve seen from many people. For some reason, the search results prioritize items that haven’t been updated in weeks AND spam tags/irrelevant brand names. That, or only top sellers’ items are listed first which doesn’t exactly help smaller shops. 

Next, and this is more of a personal issue,  I used to get featured every now and then, and it was so motivating considering I didn’t have many followers or sales. I would spend hours updating my shop, going outside and taking photos, and coming up with descriptive captions for every item. Ever since last summer, I haven’t gotten on the explore page once. I know there’s more people on depop now and tastes change, but it’s led me to spend less and less time on the app. No exposure means no sales, after all. 

Also I’ve noticed that most items getting featured have little to no description which puts me off buying anything from there. It all feels very plain. I know you can just message sellers for more details, but now it’s hard to find a caption that isn’t only two words long. For example, there was one that just said: “beige pants.” No size or brand or measurements lol.

Hopefully depop will improve on the algorithm and find some way to promote smaller shops. This is a great app, don’t get me wrong. Often I’ll come across some beautiful displays in sellers’ photos and it inspires me. Beyond that, the people I’ve interacted with, sellers and buyers alike, have been so sweet and professional. It’s a great community and tbh I’d like to see more of an emphasis on that, perhaps in an official depop forum where people can share tips, discuss fashion and help each other out. The reddit page does this already to an extent, but it would be nice to see something like it within the app.",True,2020-07-19 19:48:03,"{'id': 9609949, 'body': ""Hey Mai!

3,Taorcb,"Good Community, Mediocre App","Depop is great and it’s core functions work well, the people are generally trustworthy. Prices vary from absolute steals to extortionate, but are generally fair. Unlike other secondhand/vintage buying and selling spaces most of the people on depop are amateurs, so items tend to be under or over priced and, slightly more annoyingly, people often don’t know how to accurately describe things. Measurements aren’t always trustworthy, some sellers don’t know how to describe them (this is especially a problem for suit sizes, the “s” means short, not small, guys), and sometimes descriptions are actively unhelpful, like one seller I found who describes nearly everything as “fits xs-xl depending on desired fit” and won’t post the tagged size. If you’re looking for something specific, or you’re an enthusiast for something specific (say, watches), this app is not for you.

The app has a lot of quality of life issues. You can set your size for some things but not others, so depop knows my shoe size but not my size in outerwear. There’s no way to set a size in suit sizes, and no way to list an item by its suit size, which makes it nigh impossible to search for blazers etc, and some categories just don’t exist. There’s no explicit category for vests, for example, and categories that are nested in more competent platforms like cardigans inside sweaters simply aren’t, when they exist at all. You can search in the sweater category, or the cardigan category, but cardigans won’t come up in sweater searches unless the seller has listed it wrong (which many have). Theres no built-in way to make an offer or combine posts into discounted bundles, you have to message the seller and they have to manually lower the price or make a new listing entirely. There’s a lot of design flaws and minor inconveniences that like this that other platforms just don’t have, and some lingering bugs, though they seem to be getting better.

Depop doesn’t really have its own moderation and all payments are processed through PayPal, so if you don’t pay through your PayPal account and you get scammed it’s possible that you’ll just lose the money since PayPal might not keep a record of the transaction. Rules against dropshipping don’t seem to be enforced. I’ve only had one problem on this app where a seller marked a listing as shipped and deleted their account, but I got my money back through PayPal’s dispute process. If you’re smart about it you’ll be fine; there are bad actors on all platforms so I can’t hate depop too much for this.

All in all if you’re a buyer there’s better platforms out there. I’d suggest poshmark, or good old fashioned eBay. Most of the large depop sellers sell on other platforms anyways. If you know what you’re looking for there’s gold to be found, but there’s gold everywhere else too and depop doesn’t have much else going for it. It... works.",False,2020-12-27 02:34:22,

3,zee ruff,A purely honest review of Depop,"Ok so I forget how long I’ve been on Depop. Maybe a couple months or so? A good friend of mine introduced me to it and I’ve been a little obsessed. It takes me a while to buy things because I like to save money. I look for something literally everywhere to see if I can find it at a cheaper price. Why pay $90 for something that’s worth $40?? Anyway... though I haven’t sold anything yet, I have a love hate(not really hate but more of a meh) relationship with this app and I feel like there are some things that can be fixed.

1) Buying more than one item at once

So I’ve tried to buy multiple items from multiple buyers or multiple items from one buyer and to keep it simple...it’s hectic. I get that bundling is an option but that’s complicated ESPECIALLY if the seller takes days on end to reply to a simple question. But that’s a whole other issue. I know it would take a lot of time but seriously, I’m sure they can find a way to have some sort of a shopping bag feature so I can buy like 10 things at once. 

2) The explore page 

I’ll keep this one brief. It’s come to my attention that the stuff on the explore page is from Depop famous people. But if I don’t like it, I don’t think it should be the first thing I see. So, maybe Depop should reconsider. The explore page should be personalized to fit each and everyone’s style and find things that people like at a price range that best suits them.

3) WARNING: NOT ALL BUYERS AND SELLERS ARE COOL

Though Depop is a cool app, and I’ve had good interactions with sellers, some buyers (and sellers too) can be straight up rude. So tread lightly... 
I’ve seen fights in just the comment sections?? If you’re mature enough to start an online business, you should be able to deal with an annoying customer properly. And if you are mature enough to have a paypal account or a debit/ credit card, you should be able to handle yourself if a seller  is being a jerk. Business is business, I suppose.",False,2017-12-04 11:59:50,

2,@forevertrends,Developers should read,"Depop is an amazing concept. In the recent months I've noticed a huge decline in the apps quality. And many people are making the same comments here. It's bothered me so much so that I'm actually leaving an app review. I've had multiple tech issues that I've sent requests for which have been completely ignored.
1️⃣ The app is very glitchy it will unexpectedly close or not load all your saved items and the list goes on. But that's not even my main reason for this review. 
2️⃣ The explore page is so frustrating the same people get featured constantly.  The times that I have been featured were completely wasted. They have posted items of mine that were already sold on the explore page TWICE. Meanwhile I had tagged them in items that were super nice but didn't have exposure that they needed. Instead of considering posting those they posted two items that I had already sold. Like what's the use? 
3️⃣ I think the amount of people on the app has grown and they really need to figure out how they are going to give smaller accounts with potential the rightful amount of exposure. I started selling semi regularly and decided to up my picture quality and put more effort into the app. Since then the app's population has grown so my items are really getting lost in the madness. Things need to be set up in an appropriate matter so that everyone can sell things comfortably. I've done everything that I can on my end. They need a better way of promoting their sellers and posting the same 4 people daily on the explore page is not the way to do it. 
4️⃣ Like I said more people are on the app and so buying things is also hard. They need to find a way to streamline things more effectively so that people can find what they are trying to buy. The new ""brand feature"" was a mediocre attempt at that. So from the perspective of a buyer it's also getting difficult to navigate around the app. The more they grow the harder it will be for them to organize that but it's very necessary. 

I used to be excited to use the app the last thing they want is the app turning into the mess that poshmark is. An old clothes graveyard. To protect the integrity and efficiency of their app they need to find a better way of doing things. More deals on their end I love the newsletters on what's selling, or things like the cyber Monday hashtag. Buyers should get notifications when someone discounts something 50% off. These things would be regulated and monitored so that they aren't excessive and messy like poshmark is but something along those lines. Do better depop the ignoring tech issues and the huge gap between big sellers and smaller accounts is horrible and making faithful app users like me rethink the amount of time we put into the app.",False,2017-12-13 13:28:50,

3,NinjaFlavoredPringles,Long time user,"Depop is great for online thrifting. There are a lot of unique pieces to find from individual sellers who are able to build their platform from the ground up. However, being on this app for a couple years now, I have noticed many changes and issues.

1. SCROLLING ISSUES
This one is not a BIG problem but I believe it’s some kind of bug. When you browse, scroll down and click on an item, the page will be brought back to the top at the start of the listings. It’s super annoying and I hope this gets fixed asap.

2. TOP SELLER FAVORITISM
This next one has been a huge ongoing issue - depop does not cater to small sellers NEARLY as much as they do to top sellers. For many of these top sellers, negative reviews (in fair use) will be deleted to preserve a top seller’s pristine respiration. They ARE making depop the most money after all! And yes depop is TAKING a portion of the seller’s profit. I have noticed some sellers had their set percentage (for depop) changing without notice or any information beyond that, but it has never happened to me before so that is unconfirmed. Just be wary, I’d say.

3. DEPOP STAFF IGNORING REPORTS
Depop does not stick to their own rules. There is a ban on dropshipping (sourcing items from cheap fast fashion websites and price gouging) which was enacted quite recently (late March I believe) and they banned tons of accounts that do this. However there are still tons of drop shippers that are more “discreet,” and reporting them constantly WITH proof will get you NO response from depop.

4. EXCESSIVE TAGGING
This is another example of Depop ignoring sellers who break rules. Almost everywhere you will see excessive tagging on posts that have NOTHING to do with the description. A seller could post a listing for a book and tag “vintage 50s 60s 70s 80s deadstock shirt dress pants” etc. and if they are reported, again you will most likely get NO response whether it is an email or an action on the staff’s part.

5. FAKE RARE ITEMS AND PRICE GOUGING
One of the most infamous communities on Depop is the Brandy Melville community. While most are in fair use, be warned that most clothing/accessories from Brandy Melville when posted as listings on depop will be described as “rare” or “discontinued” and the prices will be gouged excessively. By “rare” I mean the BM website could be down for two weeks or so as they’ve been known to do recently. $15-$30 clothing can be seen as expensive as $300. Even if the clothing is not rare. They are in their rights to prove their items however they want, but be warned if you’re looking for these clothes.

6. AUCTIONS AND RAFFLES
Depop allows free prize competitions. This means one could “enter” a seller’s raffle through liking the post, following them on other platforms, sharing their posts, etc. (anything FREE). However, you will see a lot of raffles that although don’t REQUIRE payment, many sellers will accept payment for extra entries. I personally have seen people accept money through Venmo and cashapp, but since it isn’t “required” it is not against depop’s rules. This is kind of a loophole on the seller’s part which many people deem as unfair. This is another issue users have reported on without getting so much as a response from depop staff.

7. PAYPAL
This is just a warning for those wanting to BUY from sellers. ALWAYS USE PAYPAL. Do NOT make transactions outside Depop! Do NOT message a seller outside Depop! If ANY seller tries to engage in any of these activities it is a SCAM! AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS THERE ARE SO MANY SCAMMERS ON DEPOP.

Overall, Depop is a great app! I find that there are more unique, vintage and alternative pieces than Poshmark. I have also seen AMAZING deals! I DO recommend Depop as a buyer, but as a seller all I have to say is to be WARY! Know the rules, follow them, and if you ever find yourself in a situation where you absolutely need help from Depop staff, well, I hope you’re religious because you might need to pray for it. Lol. But seriously. That is why I rate this app 3/5 stars. I hope they don’t delete my “bad” review.

2,17MJD20,Extremely frustrating,"I love the idea of this app. I think it’s a great idea to have platforms like this for unique clothing from small businesses and individuals.

 That said I have had multiple ongoing issues with trying to sell clothing and accessories with this platform. 
I am a vintage and costume clothing and accessories collector looking to down size. I spent a good amount of time coming up with a branding, marketing plan for my shop and spent time taking photos, having a friend over to model, etc. So I was thrilled when I finally made a sale. 

I had issues with the shipping label through depop and the costumer service was irritatingly slow and asked the same questions multiple times. The services is all Through email and messaging, you can’t call to talk to a person. 
Now I am having issues with getting the payment through paypal. Which could be unrelated to depop, but seeing as I can’t get answers from anyone I felt it relevant to include here. 

In addition to this I feel that the algorithm they use for sellers favors bigger established sellers that have big followings already. I don’t pretend to know anything about how algorithms work, but this one seems to make it impossible for little sellers to gain any significant sales unless they spend 24 hours a day updating and marketing their store like a full time job. 
Take this review for what it is worth, I could be an odd seller out. 

I have already deleted my listings and as soon as I get paid for my one sale I will be deleting my account.

2,Bob-Mike,Frustrating.,"Depop, I’ve been working with your app for over 2+ years. It’s a great platform for selling, I’ll admit, as it’s very easy to make a listing and get a label made for packages. However, that seems to be your app’s ONLY redeeming quality. Hence the 2 star review..

I CONTINUE to have issues with your support team. I CONTINUE to have listings removed when they don’t break your rules/guidelines. I CONTINUE to struggle getting my shop out there- getting followers and making sales. I’ve been very consistent with following the “advice” your top sellers give; I always post products that are similar to what’s trending and on the featured page, I make sure to include high quality photos with great lighting and backdrops, and always post within user guidelines. Yet, somehow, it is insanely difficult to make it on the featured page. It is insanely difficult making consistent sales. And I’m not the only seller who’s vocalized these problems before. 

So many sellers, myself included, work incredibly hard on their shops: doing our absolute best to ensure customer satisfaction, keeping track of inventory, keeping up with what’s in demand, etc. only to receive LESS support. 

Your team is nearly impossible to get in contact with. I’m genuinely convinced that the staff for this platform are using the pandemic right now as an excuse to do even less for their users. You have one contact- which is your support email, yet, upon reaching out, I’m constantly met with automatic reply’s that give “support links” as if that is going to resolve the issues at hand. I and many others have reached out to your team on issues that are very impactful on us as sellers and buyers alike, yet you continually ignore them. 
People reach out via Instagram, email, and even in the comments section on your shops within the app. 

It’s disappointing. 

You really need a support number for people to call when they need to contact someone.

Another thing to point out here:
To become a top 10 seller, you either have to own a thrift store, have your own team, be a part of the official Depop team, or own a warehouse. It is incredibly unfair. ALL of your verified sellers have the upper leg on this platform, they can even get away with going against the community guidelines. A great example of this are the people who drop ship, but make it appear as if their work is “one of a kind”.

I know this for a FACT because I know someone in Miami who owns a warehouse, and works with an ENTIRE TEAM, that has a shop on your app that is masked as an “individual seller”. 

Depop, please do better.
It’s 2020.

1,tbby1117,Shipping Choices..,"Ok so I love this app & all as a seller BUT what there was something that I noticed that REALLY irked me and I thought it was really nasty of this company to try and sneak this in .. 

When a seller is posting an item, there’s the different types of shipping options you can choose—that’s if you choose to go with Depop shipping. Anyways, once you choose the parcel size NORMALLY you’d carry on with posting your item. What I noticed though, was that if you scroll down the ‘free shipping’ option is ALREADY SELECTED (with a recommended right above...) If it was recommended, then it shouldn’t be selected. That’s money that’s being taken away from the buyers sales without their consent. In which this case happened to me.. This option was selected—automatically selected—for several weeks until I noticed that so much $$ was being taken from my sales. I think this option was created in a very discreet dirty way. 

I HIGHLY advise this gets fixed. You could be gypping sellers from making money they intend. 

1. The ‘Free Shipping’ option should be displayed so the user doesn’t have to scroll down in order to find this option. Otherwise they’re not aware and this can cause money being taken out of their sales without them choosing this option...
2. If it’s a recommended option then it should NOT be automatically selected. There’s been several times STILL that I post something and I forget to DE SELECT this option. I shouldn’t have to worry about this every time I post something /: 

I really do like this app but I don’t think this is something that should be taken lightly.. this is people’s money who are trying to make a living by bringing in extra cash.

2,Kaskas12345,Needing improvements ASAP!,"So let me start off by saying that I have been a depop buyer for over 3 years, ( I used to also be a seller.) so I was a big fan of depop and its fashion but now I have grown out of that 80s fashion doc martens/high waisted jeans with windbreaker style.
(Which is pretty much what Depop’s fashion is. It’s very exclusive.) so for a while I LOVED what depop offered, but as we grow up we often change which is what happened to me. 

So here are some negatives I have noticed
The for you page doesn’t include things I’ve ever even bought or liked. Things I’m pretty much not interested in. 
The explore page I believe needs vast improvements too. buyers don’t want to see what the company is loving, we want to see more of what we like and of sellers that aren’t so popular because it’s not fair that we get to see the same people over and over getting many chances to sell their things when there are really good sellers with great prices for their items. And if you’re doing an explore page for the company I believe the fashion should be broader, it’s often catering to those 80s/90s or weird fashion lovers and there are many people who are NOT into that so therefore the explore page is useless to them and EXCLUDES many sellers of different fashion varieties. 
Please improve on this

1,Officer_Wranglerbutt,"Terrible Support, no accountability for bad sellers, risky for buyers, fake items are rampant","I’ve made about 10 purchases in the last two months through Depop. Have had multiple sellers not ship my order until I email them to ask them (after waiting at least 3+ days before contacting them). 
An IG influencer told me she shipped an item multiple times but never did...I finally got a refund after waiting almost a month after buying the shoes and she emailed me two weeks later asking if I still wanted them. What?? Lol. I emailed customer support about the issues twice and they basically didn’t care show awful she was or that she put me through tons of trouble. 

Another seller sold me an item wrongfully labeled as designer but it was actually a really bad cheap off-brand. She changed the listing info after I asked her for a refund and claimed I was incorrect. I informed her that I screenshot the listing prior to her editing and she said I was “making her uncomfortable” but would handle the dispute in PayPal. Child, if you listed your items accurately, honesty and were not a terrible liar, I wouldn’t be bothering to “make you uncomfortable”. I’ve worked in resale for 15+ years and if she tried that offline, she would get a bad reputation very quickly. Unfortunately there are a lot of entitled, inexperienced, deceitful jerks on this app and they ruin it for the honest sellers and buyers.
Also I tried listing an item had issues. They could use a new UX designer.

Long story short, as soon as I get my last refund I am deleting my account and never looking back. In the meantime, I signed up for Poshmark a few days ago, have 260 followers already and made my first sale. The interface and features are excellent. Was super easy and everyone seems cool on there so far.",False,2020-11-10 08:38:00,"{'id': 19075041, 'body': ""Hey Mariella,\n\nWe’re sorry to hear your experience hasn't gone to plan.

1,KAG383,The worst resale app,"UPDATE:
It happened, my first time being scammed. Purchased an item, messaged seller multiple times with no response, finally opened a PayPal dispute and OVER A MONTH later got a refund. Depop barely helps with refunds all they do is direct you to use PayPal. I can’t even leave a review to warn others that this person scammed me, and how long it took to get my money. The sellers bio says “no refunds all sales final” (which is NOT allowed!) so Id like to warn others about how I got a refund, but can’t bc my “purchase” is still pending shipping, so there’s no way to give this seller a negative rating. I left some comments on their other items to warn others, and have already gotten messages about other people who this person scammed and i helped them with the refund process as they were saddened by being scammed out of their own money. 
So here we are, the buyers going through ridiculous steps and the seller gets no repercussions. 
0/5 stars. 

The WORST resale app. Every item is listed as the wrong brand to get attention, not for sale, an in search of post, or people are putting the item up for bid and say “do not buy will not refund or send the item” which is all very misleading. It makes it extremely difficult to search for an item. A lot of sellers also do not offer refunds or returns, so if you receive your item and it’s damaged, doesn’t match the description or possibly has a strange smell (because most people buy from goodwill and resell as a “vintage”) there’s not way to return it and you’re stuck with the item. Depop does not have any seller or buyer protection which means if you sell and send an item and don’t get paid, then you’re out of luck. I highly recommend poshmark or mercari for buying and reselling, they actually care about they’re users and is so much easier to navigate and find items that you’re interested in.",True,2020-09-06 18:28:01,"{'id': 14972490, 'body': ""Hey, all purchases on Depop are fully covered, if the item isn't as described you'll be able to open a dispute and return it for a full refund, just send us a report via the receipt in app.\n\nWe're here if you need us,\nTeam Depop"", 'modified': '2020-04-28T16:58:32Z'}"

1,cWill5184,"No longer my favorite app, here’s why...","If there was less than 1, I would leave it & I do NOT leave negative reviews lightly, if ever...

I’ve been selling on several other platforms for YEARS; including Vinted, Mercari, eBay, Poshmark & some popular local selling apps, but Depop USED TO BE my favorite & had a great community. 
NOT ANYMORE. 

Id been an active seller on this platform for about a year & last year, I became one of their worldwide top sellers on Labor Day. Up until the last time I accessed the app, I also had a 4.7/5 overall rating... 

However, over the last several months, a lot of deception has taken place...
Namely, this platform is NOT supportive or protective of its SELLERS. 
If you ship something & it takes awhile to get to the buyer & the buyer is not a good communicator (a lot of teenagers on this app that are still green to having an effective communication style) other than complaining to Depop, then Depop will tell them right off the bat to report the seller & get a refund. 🤯

I’ve been in sales & marketing over 17 YEARS & what you generally do in a sales environment, is ask buyers to COMMUNICATE with the SELLER FIRST... on top of the fact that I was very active in DM’s & made it clear on my profile about communication with any questions or issues...

Depop does not do this, so BE CAREFUL.
I’d written to them several times about this, but they were always very careless in their response.

Second thing, 
They changed their policy’s sometime over the last month or so, which I was not aware of & I don’t qualify to be a seller but they went & blocked me from accessing my own profile- which still has my personal & bank account info attached - so I had to warn my bank to block them, because I can’t log in to remove my personal info now 🤯🤯

BE WARNED.
I would NOT recommend this app & this is NOT based on some single incident, but MANY that brought me to the point of this review. 

I hope they become more balanced when it comes to taking care of the SELLERS, who are helping this app make money in the first place.

1,claire.eveskcige,Awful Service,"I’m extremely conflicted here. I have been using depop for YEARS and loved it but now... I hate them more than anything. I recently (6 months ago) made a post with cannabis as the PICTURE. The description however, was asking about resin earrings. The clear art product made for creating objects? I wanted PLUGS made of cannabis and resin. That was IT. I woke up this morning to an email saying my post has been removed, fine that’s okay. I can find it somewhere else. But then I got another email telling me my account was entirely closed because my activity violated their rules saying I was selling TOBACCO, bongs, pipes, etc. MY POST WAS ASKING FOR FREAKIN EARRINGS!!!!! And my account was deleted. 
4 years of Depop loyalty, never breaking a rule, AND I DIDNT BREAK ONE YET EITHER!!! And they delete my account regardless. I know they didn’t even read the description of my item beforehand because they said I was selling tobacco products. If they HAD read the description they would know I was looking for earrings. So they deleted my account based off an IMAGE rather than my actual activity and I am DISGUSTED. 
Depop, I was literally asking for cannabis resin made EARRINGS. Not cannabis, not a bong, not a pipe, EARRINGS. So tell me why none of your employees actually READ my description? 
Thanks for ruining my second form of income, and deleting my account and everything I wanted to purchase with it. 
I insist next time you READ THE DESCRIPTION before acting like robots and just deleting everything. 
I can’t imagine what kind of people are behind this app... brainless and heartless.

1,Casbah Calling,depop hates legitimate sellers and buyers,"i’ve been a vintage seller on here for 6 months and i’m ready to move to a different platform. the new algorithm makes it really hard to actually find what you are looking for. cheap earring shops and fast fashion resellers clog up the search results with spam tags and unrelated key words.

depop doesn’t care about their sellers and they refuse to ban spam tags and drop shipping. it’s people like that who give this app a bad name. “vintage” sellers who try and sell clothes as 70s are also the worst.  i have seen some of my favorite sellers leave this app for etsy or ebay and i probably will too. 

some of the users are really mean to sellers and will harass you for not getting their way. i have received awful comments about some of my prices which are fairly cheap compared to other vintage sellers. i clearly state that i don’t take offers but i receive them all day anyway. i have received messages accusing me of “ gentrifying thrift stores” even though my area the thrift store have an excess of clothes. if you have a problem with reselling thrifted clothes then this is not the app for you. i have had some lovely customers, but overall it’s not a very friendly community. 

i have had several bad buying experiences on here as well. the first thing i ever bought was from the verified seller betterdaze. when i got it, it had three large tears in the back from them squeezing into it to model it and it was also missing a button. none of these things were discolored in the ad. when i told them about the problem they were unapologetic and rude. i don’t recommend buying from top/verified sellers because they don’t care about you. i have also had several other bad experiences with top sellers since.",False,2020-12-30 15:47:23,"{'id': 20159550, 'body': ""Hey there,\n\nThanks for reaching out about this.\n\nWe've been working hard to crack down on spammers on Depop, and with the help of awesome users like you we think we've made a difference.\n\nIf you happen to come across other users abusing spamming or hashtags/their description box like this feel free to report them to us as well!

5,Syneriam,Improvements,"I love depop, it's easy to use and they only take 10% which compared to other platforms, its basically nothing. However this app needs many improvements. One would be the ability to zoom in and out of pictures to help us see the details better. Another problem is the explore page! I have been on the explore page a few times (3 times maybe?) I know you have to have great pictures to end up there but most of the time I see the exact same users getting featured instead of newer ones. Maybe it would help if there was  something the users can do to put their names out there. It seems like if you don't end up on the explore page you don't sell at all. Another thing (which I know the app can't control) is that there are SO MANY sellers yet theres only a few buyers. Everyone sells but no one buys, i wish more people knew about this app so it could move quicker, like mercari or posh. One big tip I have is to NEVER pay outside of the app. There are many scammers here (just like everywhere else) that try to make you email them or pay them through other apps, this should not be an option. I'd rather have 10% removed than lose my item to a scammer. Other than that the app is pretty great. I just wish they had more focus on newer users instead of focusing on the already popular ones.",False,2016-06-23 17:08:36,
3,brightbby,I have some suggestions!,"I love depop but I have a few ideas that I think would improve the app.
Firstly, I've noticed that it doesn't always tell me when an item was posted/updated. Sometimes it's covered up by the recommendations (probably a glitch) and sometimes it just doesn't show it at all. I like to know when it was posted so I know if I should grab an item quickly or if I'm likely to have some time before it sells out.
Secondly, I think it would be nice if it showed the prices of items in the search results, recommendations, and on sellers pages like it did in the old version. That way I'm not spending time clicking on items I can't afford and it's easier to filter through what I'd like to buy.
Finally, I think it would be interesting if in addition to saved items, you could also add items to collections the same way you can on instagram. I use the saving feature for items that I am seriously considering purchasing in the near future, but I think it would be cool if I could also make collections for shoes, dresses, shirts, etc. that I like instead of scrolling endlessly through my likes to find them.
I've also noticed that after using the app for about 20 minutes (esp when changing search queries and going back and forth between pages multiple times) the app crashes. This isn't a very big deal to me though and I'm more interested in seeing these other features being implemented as I feel they would make the app easier to use.",False,2017-08-20 22:10:45,"{'id': 1062226, 'body': ""Hey, thanks for the review.

5,Vibrant-Impulse,Great app for selling !,"I love depop, it's a great community of artists and fashion lovers who are very excited about what they do and are supportive of each other. The app is user friendly and easy to get a hang of. As a buyer, I'm impressed with the quality and selection of the items for sale. As a seller, I highly recommend this app. You can connect really well with your customers, and listing an item is as easy as making a post to any other social media platform. I love the transparency of their rating system. I used to sell on some other online sites, but my home computer isn't as reliable as it used to be. I know I can rely on my phone and it's so helpful that I can work on my shop while sitting in a waiting room or riding the bus! 

The only down side is the frequency of lil glitches like notifications staying after being acknowledged and the app just quitting out. but over all the bugs seem to get fixed in a timely manner and its not that bad. 

If I could recommend an improvement, I think the ability to send a tracking number to someone via a submission form on the sale page would be amazing! It could be like the star ratings/review. Right now I just message people their tracking numbers, but I like the idea of the tracking number being attached to the transaction form.",False,2016-02-24 14:33:04,
5,Fridgeasaurus xx,Almost perfect,"I love this app and use it daily as a seller and a buyer. It's the most user friendly market app I've tried and now that the ipad photo album display problem has been resolved (apple's fault), it's better than ever. Support is very responsive as well. 
I've only ever had one problem with a seller not delivering, and resolved it with a polite conversation and a refund. Seems like the majority of problems stem from bad trades and taking transactions outside the app, both easy to avoid.
I hope Depop continues to attract makers and sellers of unique things, and they've done an outstanding job on that front. The biggest improvement for me would be for Depop to expand its user base to include more older 18+ folks willing to pay a reasonable asking price for items- haggling with 15 year old kids who then ask you to hold until they can get money from their parents gets old. Other than that, I'm a depop user for life- I really enjoy interacting with other users and the Depop team, and it's helped me conceptualize how I'd like my dream vintage shop to run.",False,2016-10-07 19:33:45,
4,casey625,Nice people overall - app could use some simple fixes,"I’ve been using depop for over a year. I have to say it really works for buying and selling things. I have only dealt with honest and normal people so far (buying/selling mostly kids stuff). That is a big relief. Shipping is always a big cost so finding people in your area is advantageous. The fees are not low but I guess in line with eBay. Though the app is much less flexible than eBay and my gripes are: 1. Not possible to insert children's sizes or search by specific child size. 2. Not possible to copy text (at least from iPhone 6) - very annoying when inserting the same hashtags in items (like for kids). 3. Now that I am buying as well as selling I would appreciate keeping the funds in depop to avoid the 3,5% paypal charge every time (maybe this is possible in some regions, not sure). 4. Photos have to be in square format (good to know before you photograph everything you want to sell in the wrong format). The positive point is that you can gain a following and have a better chance of selling to the same clients since they see your new posts if they “follow” you. Good app, but definitely room for improvement by fixing these relatively simple things. 5. Why not have search alerts like shpock - this works SO well and helps buyers and sellers transact quickly.",False,2017-02-18 12:03:57,
4,kaylacreative,Definitely a fan,"The 3 experiences I've had with purchasing items have all been perfectly fine. Items received matched the photo, prices were okay, and owners were nice. I was more than pleased with all 3 purchases. Most other experiences I've had as far as conversation about certain items, questions, etc. have all been with super friendly and helpful people as well. And I love that I'm able to basically thrift anywhere I want. However, there are certain times when I've become annoyed by ""trolling"" (the only word I can think to use for it). Everyone is trying to make a buck if you're posting on the app, that's no secret - whether you're trying to save up for something specific or just trying to make some extra $. I can't help but get annoyed, though, when I get bombarded by message after message asking if I'm interested in anything and on and on after I've followed or liked someone's post. This doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it just turns me off from buying from that person; just gives me that ""car-salesman"" vibe. Idk how you'd realistically be able to regulate that, but I wanted to give an honest review. When I receive a message, I usually just don't respond and stop giving attention to their shop. All-in-all I love the app and have had no major issues with it.",False,2016-09-20 10:07:03,
3,Yubipop,Prefer old Depop,"The new update isn't that great, the red is pretty obnoxious and not pleasant to look at. When refreshing my own shop, it gets pretty annoying since only half the screen can be pulled down to refresh (so it's really awkward to refresh when I get such a small space to swipe down). Most of the time, a lot of the buttons and part of the text will glitch out and I won't be able t see it and it's really hard to click. I really enjoyed the old setup where I could see what other people liked and not have my notifications at the top. For the looks, I prefer the green buy button from before as this one doesn't really have a nice font choice. The letters are ultra bold and look flattened, the contrasting colors are also distracting. Really not a fan of the font, doesn't look very neat.  The bottom buttons look a little off and aren't as nice to click (sometimes it doesnt feel like you clicked them but you did or the other way around). Even though Im not a fan of the color, I dislike the font choice even more because it looks like the fonts from high school presentations that were thrown together. Still leaving 3 stars though because I hope they'll be able to have a new update and fix these. Especially the glitches, refresh screen size and font.",False,2017-07-20 22:34:05,
2,desstromberg,Love it! But too many bugs..,"This is seriously my favorite app that I've ever downloaded. Not only have I bought from great people, but I've sold to them too! However, for some reason there's been too many issues with this app. For starters, it won't load properly. The last item that's loaded is over 4 hours ago when I know for a fact that there's a lot more items that have been posted. Another thing is a recent bug with buying. Sellers have to set their items as meet in person only and include the shipping price within the total, so the buyer doesn't receive the ""error purchasing"" popup. Which is another inconvenience for buyers since they have to individually message their address. Another bug is that if you mark something sold (like sold outside of depop) then it will leave an annoying notification that you can not get rid of unless the sold items list gets deleted! A major suggestion is to add a filter so you can find what's in your own country! I'm tired of finding cute things only to find out it's overseas and twice the amount wanting to be paid! So unfair! Also, there should be a separate report button for scammers!! This would help so many people rather than waiting on depop to reply to individual messages. Don't get me wrong, I LOOOVVEEE this app, just needs a lot of help",False,2014-08-05 11:26:30,
3,cocobutternut,Scammers everywhere & depop takes a massive fee,"No matter what you say/do on this app someone is going to criticize you. The buyers are so cheap and snide, they think you're being rude and when you tell them your price is firm or your item is over like $20. I used to like this app, but the more experience I get I dislike it more and more. People get especially caught up with shipping prices, like they expect it to be free like with a big retailer. THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE SHIPPING OUT OF THEIR POCKETS!! SHIPPING IS NOT CHEAP! 

Also, there are scammers everywhere that will ask you to email them/PayPal f&f them. It is your own responsibility to find out who's a scammer and who's not, because Depop does nothing about it until the scammers actually make their move. They also take a ridiculous %10 of your earnings. 

A classic situation: You sell something for $20, cheap users ask to lower it to $19, which seems like they're just doing it for fun, it's so ridiculous. You use your own shipping for $5, the buyer asks why shipping is so expensive. They either say ""no thanks... too expensive"" or if they're considerate enough they'll buy it, but then Depop takes about $2, and you're out $5 or more from shipping.

4,Amysjd,very solid selling app,"good app overall! favors vintage/handmade stuff (for getting featured) and unique stuff--definitely caters to a certain type of style/aesthetic. 

buying: smooth transactions all around, you can find rlly cheap stuff and more expensive things here. I'm not familiar with the return policy since I've never returned, but one con is how people can rate you. I think depop should adopt something more similar to the selling app Mercari where the buyer and seller can't see what they rated each other until AFTER they have both put in their ratings, that way you don't get a bad review as a buyer simply because you have a seller a bad review. 

selling: I've done better with selling on some other apps, but I've still sold a couple things on here. you have a huge advantage if you're selling things that depop likes (see what I said before) because features items are almost instantly sold. anyways, the rating system again is frustrating, but still fine. depop frowns upon using photos that are not yours (like taking from a website's modeling photos) which I like because that's not necessarily an accurate display of the item, but I can understand the frustration too.",False,2016-08-13 16:54:42,
3,Maryzaint,Beware of scammers!,"Depop is a great concept, but the app seems to be filled with tons of underage teens wanting to swap items, or convince you to pay them with concealed cash through the mail. I've also come across a lot of scammers. I'm still waiting on PayPal to return my funds from a person that never intended to send me the item I purchased. Depop doesn't do much about it unless you report the person, then they'll send you a generic email after a week telling you the scammers profile was deleted (can't they just create another profile and scam again?). Then you're on your own to get your $ back. There's also a lot of lowballers and people that will insult your prices, even if they're collectibles. The worst thing though is I've seen is cyber bullying on the app. Seriously, on a selling and buying app! I had a 16 year old call me names because she didn't like a question I asked, and I've seen one woman's account be harassed by a few specific girls. And Depop does nothing about it. It's kind of ridiculous. But hey, it's cheaper than eBay! And I like that it looks similar to Instagram but you can swipe photos. I think Depop needs to crack down a bit on scammers and start enforcing an 18+ rule and require a paypal account or credit card.",False,2015-08-17 17:47:47,
1,student22347,"Glitch, Scammers, and will not issue a refund","Depop seemed amazing at first, but the first time I purchased something on the app (this entire transaction was completed in-app), there was a glitch and the seller did not receive the prepaid shipping label and the purchase did not show up on my profile. Therefore, the seller had to pay for shipping a second time at the post office and we could not leave feedback for each other. I contacted Depop so the seller could receive a refund but it was so complicated and she decided that she did not want to go through the trouble. I then asked Depop for a refund of the money I paid for shipping which did not end up being used for shipping due to the glitch. Depop is telling me to contact the seller to initiate the refund but I do not want her to go through further trouble for me. Besides, it has been over two weeks since I made the purchase and originally contacted Depop. I am severely disappointed at the way Depop has been handling the glitch, making it so complicated to receive a refund, and replying to my emails so late that this problem has been dragged out for so long. Furthermore, I have seen more scammers than buyers on the app. I do not feel safe using the app because Depop does not verify users. I hope that these issues can be solved quickly or Depop will experience a drop in users.",False,2017-09-13 01:38:03,

The ""activity"" to see what the people you follow have liked recently. It was the only way I found shops I actually like. Or items I'm actually interested in because it's based on who I follow so therefore it's my style rather than the god awful single style they promote on their explore page. It's all about thrasher and flames and totally unwearable clothes. They also never choose my photos for the explore page anymore which they used to constantly as soon as I posted.

I began selling my clothes on here and I can honestly say its one of the best experiences I've had because it has an Instagram-like format and is very easy to use! The only downsides are the scammers and swindlers. I've been victimized twice :( The only problem I have that I think needs to change is the popular page where the items that have been sold need to be marked. Other than that it's really good :) Oh yeah, also I think there should be filters for which country I want to view and filters for shirts, tops, band merch, makeup, etc. I keep trying to look for a certain vintage camera but when I do find it, all the sellers are Italian and I have no idea what they're saying so it's hard to communicate with them.",False,2014-07-28 17:20:12,

I NEED to clear out my little review/notification thing but I can't because some sellers automatically use depop's shipping service (the set prices) and then don't use the shipping label. I have almost every item I've purchased with me, and I can't review them/the sellers because the products are ""awaiting shipping."" I don't even know what else changed but my sales have gone sooo low and I'm tired of random items getting removed. The whole ""used makeup"" removal of items is completely random. In my experience, I very rarely get ""customer service"" from an actual person! So many more scams on the app as well ☹️

Originally got depop to sell some things I haven't used, don't need anymore, but now I feel like I'm constantly reposting things that get deleted!

As a seller, I would like to see improvements. Mainly, I don't like that we have to use paypal to sell products easily and accept payments. Can you guys update and allow us to do it straight through the app. First of all, PayPal charges us another unmentioned fee when we're selling through Depop, so I never really know exactly what I'm making off the sale. Plus, Depop already takes a fee so there's two fees we're hit with automatically. Secondly, I haven't had the best protection through PayPal and up until I began using this app, I was boycotting it. I simply don't trust it. It has trusted scammers over me on multiple occasions and makes me weary that with every sale I make, I might come across one of those horrible buyers that takes advantage of the system and get screwed out of clothes or money.

They responded a day later with a 2 sentence email, saying I named and shamed someone. I reported a buyer for leaving me a 1 star review and clearly lying in the review and not offering prof of there claims, then this person got hostile with me when I would t offer a refund, I screen shooted our conversation and posted it, I was warning other sellers about this person, because I when I reported them depop just said ""sorry we can't do anything"" So my entire shop was deleted because I wanted people about someone screwing sellers over. Hope depop enjoyed ALL the money I brought them the last year since they take 10% of everything you make, and sometimes depop ""glitches"" and takes the 10% twice, but they always claim it's a mistake, even though it happens 80% of the time.

1) the fees- it can be very frustrating when i list an item at a relatively cheap price (way less than what i bought it for) and then when it is purchased i lose even more money because of depop's fees. frankly, i don't understand why they take money out of our profits and for what? the app still crashes, and has its issues that aren't getting fixed.
2) usernames- please please please let us change our usernames after we've signed up!
3) it crashes- depop crashes pretty much every time i use it for 10 minutes or more. seriously needs to get fixed.

Also, many users are trying to buy outside of the app so that they can keep your money without actually selling anything. I also think it's ridiculous that the app takes 10% out of every purchase. Considering it's a smaller app (NOT EBAY) you would think they'd lower the price. TIPS: 1) don't BUY if seller wants to you want pay through PayPal friends and family. 2) don't ""swap"" your items with other users as there is absolutely no guarantee you'll get anything in return. 3)used items are used items.

Edit: I think it's really shady that depop won't address all the valid criticism it's getting even going so far as to delete users comments and even the reviews on the app store so they won't have to confront how unhappy everyone is with this update.

5,💖dd,Great! Few suggestions..,"• Search by brand/category/size.. You can easily type in ""nike"" or something in search, but people tag things that arent related to get more views. Also category to specify on shoes, pants, etc. like we fill this stuff out when we are selling so how do we search it? 

• Accept the product.. I like poshmarks concept of accepting the product after you receive it so you dont get scammed out of your money. 

• Selling continous scroll.. I dont know what this is called but when you look through a persons closet, you should have the option to browse thru by just scrolling (like on instagram) but you can only see the description of items by clicking each individual one.
 
• Start up tutorial?.. Maybe like advice for shipping because when i started i lost some money because i wasnt charging the right amount for shipping. Maybe just me though. 

• Prepaid shipping.. If this is possible please consider it! Poshmark has a $4.99 shipping priority and it makes it much easier to ship, so you dont have to calculate it or go out of your way to print out a label.

Other than that, good app, doesnt charge too much. I like the visual appearance of this much more than any other selling app. 😊",False,2015-05-01 08:44:30,

The last thing I would change is the ability to hide things that have already been sold. Sometimes you see something you really like and its either no longer available or not the right size. If these things were added I think this app would be even better! I love that it is already connected to PayPal making buying and selling easy!",False,2015-06-13 21:22:32,
5,Bgsdogluvr,So Far So Good,"I was a regular buyer and seller on Mercari, with no negative feedbacks, and over 100 great ones, but they still decided to delete my account. Mercari is quite awful. A nightmare, actually. I had to look for a new place to sell, and DEPOP fits the bill! So far it's much better than Mercari and poshmark. The whole social aspect isn't really my thing, but a lot of people like it and I can work with it. It's easy to use, users seem friendly, and they don't have absurd rules like other selling apps. I have only been using it for a couple of days, but I think it'll work for me! If you're fed up with Mercari this might be the place for you. 8.5/10 in my book.",False,2017-03-05 06:34:41,
1,Mustardeer,awful,"First transaction: I buy a watch from a local guy. He takes 2.5 months to ship it. I message him asking why it took months ( we both live in the same city). He just blocks my account.

2nd transaction. I buy an item. It never gets here. Months later I ask depop for help. They tell me to talk to paypal. I reach out to paypal and win the case and get my money back. Three months later the seller dms me apologizing and blaming the buggy app and saying how it's a nightmare to sell on it.

3rd and final transaction: I buy a hat. Keep getting an error message. Seller suggests I just paypal her instead. Her email bounces. She gives me another. I paypal her. She says she'll ship the item tomorrow then she blocks my account and stops responding to emails. I cancel the transaction via paypal and get my money back. I try to report the 3rd seller to depop, they respond with a generic copy and paste bs email. 

Basically the app is super buggy, the system is awful and does not protect the buyer nor the seller. Customer service is nonexistent. Although you can score a few rare vintage and modern finds it's just not worth it to bother with this app. I say stick with ebay/etsy/craigslist/brick & mortar for at least the next 5 years.

It still was not fixed when I just recently deleted in early July of 2016. 
There's also a buttload of drama and spammers on the site. Not worth it, at all. 

ORIGINAL: I do really love this app, just browsing through items is super fun. It does bother me how buggy it is and how they don't seem to even try and fix them. Most recently, sellers whom I have NO interest in, nor am I following, keep showing up in my feed. They say they're ""working on it,"" but the last update didn't fix anything.

However, I really don't like how there isn't a ""XS, S, M, L, XL,"" etc. section to categorize your tops. Also, for the jeans, it would be a huge improvement if you could have the sizes also in ""00, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6"" etc. Honestly, if these changes were made, I'd absolutely love this app even more!

The amount of time you spend on the app, for example, liking other 100 photos, doesn't reflect on the chances to be seen on the explore page. The explore page doesn't really explore related items,most of the time, it just show you items that you look at and didn't buy. Explore page is not Google ad space guys.

Also, I think the Depop fee is too high. I also wish there was a ""sale"" button or ""option"" when making a listing. Ex: having a sliding button to make your item 20% off without having to manually change the price. And once your sale is over you can slide the button off and it it will change your item back to the original price.

The app is very easy to use and keeps things simple (unlike Vinted, which is just tweens selling junk no one wants). I also like that they have a number of fashion bloggers and popular boutiques also selling on their app. My only qualm is that the app crashes quite a bit!

I think the app would be a lot smoother if there was some sort of shipping label pdf printable via E-mail, like mercari.

However, the new update is terrible. It freezes and closes out frequently, especially when trying to view seller profiles, which makes it almost unusable. On top of that, the design is aesthetically unpleasant.

They have withdrawn the sellers fee from me, and my PayPal shows that they have withdrawn nearly 3x that amount ON TOP of the sellers fee per item separately.

There is no customer service number, no way to report fraudulent accounts, nothing. So if you're willing to trust people to buy things properly and you are prepared to handle all of those cases outside of Depop, then go ahead.

PayPal has a claims system, but I'd imagine it's 10x more difficult if you paid with a debit card/bank account. Depop customer service is woefully inadequate. Depop imagines itself as a safe haven for the ""odd"" to sell crap, but without an actual system to mitigate fraud and with 0 customer service, I suggest avoiding this app. I've made 10 purchases and had an issue with almost EVERY SINGLE ONE.

Everything clashes way too much and in no way represents the users of the app. It looks like a website design I would've done when I was ten and that's not saying much.

I for one like the way the app works as far as selling and buying goes, just move on to the next person if they have a stingy attitude. :)",False,2016-04-04 16:33:24,
4,Depop King,"Depop is revolutionary, design lacks","I think depop is the best market place app on the App Store. This is because it's personal, there is a younger age group, and users are promoted to take unique and good photos. 5 stars in that regard and I weigh that heavily. However, this new update is ugly. The red is too dark, the black text doesn't attract me, and the font does not look good at all. It makes me uncomfortable. I really loved the old icon with ""hello were open"", and the light red it has was eye catching and attractive. I like the formatting of the update, but when it comes to colors and typography Depop is seriously lacking.",False,2017-07-25 21:21:12,

However the amount of shops that are doing things that are against the supposed app policies is ridiculous, and the depop team won't do anything about it.

I find it quite ridiculous how much favoritism is on the app, I've been using it for over a year and have made over 200 sales with no bad reviews yet they won't put me as a suggested user but they will suggest you follow users with 4 reviews two of which being negative.

Super easy communication, super easy to find products, mostly everyone has ratings, great prices, they only take 10 % out of your sales unlike apps like posh market which take 20 %.. Leaving you to price your items higher, therefore harder to sell on those other apps.. 
Plus if you get scammed or for some reason need a refund for whatever faulty item you bought.. They'll refund you! 
Also I really like how you get instantly paid and don't have to wait until the buyer accepts your item in the mail, or reviews you.. So if you need the money to ship their item.. It's right in your PayPal account..

(4) You get an excessive amount of people trying to low-ball you constantly. You'll post an item that's worth maybe $100 and list it as $30 and the buyers will offer $5 LOL

So much for doing everything through the app and being safe there is no seller protection!!

This distracts me from more important notifications like PM/DMs I need to reply to or read. It has been like this for almost a month for me. Before that, when I tried to leave feedback on some items, the app would crash and close out on me back to back, restarted and re downloaded. 

Depop, you can use some work in this aspect of the app. 

I was also reading tortiselle's review as well. I agree, the SOLD icon sticker needs to be shown on items that have BEEN SOLD so we can clean out our likes and saved items.

1,Kristen-Marie,Scammers galore and depop does nothing!,"I had a few good experiences with sellers early on who gave me /sort of/ good deals but recently have gotten scammed twice and depop has done nothing to prevent this from happening. When multiple customers file a complaint against a user, Depop should do way more to ensure a safe community otherwise it is pointless to even use at all. I have filed many reports to them about a current user and have received no message back for weeks. I was going to sell here despite the high transaction fee but probably not. 

My advice? 
-Don't buy from anyone with no seller reviews or if their reviews are from other sketchy accounts (probably their own.) it's not fair to new sellers but depop does nothing to ensure buyer protection currently. 

-Never pay through PayPal friends and family, if a seller asks for this, report them. They are undeniably scamming you, even if you do end up getting your item.

3,JeanGrimm,Unpleasing Update,"I love depop, and have had a great experience using it for about a year! While I like the general layout of the update (notifications and receipts being moved to your profile, etc) the design itself is clunky. The font is strange, the blocky ""buy"" button is off putting, the whole aesthetic is just really heavy and distracting. Depop should focus on the items being sold, but the new aesthetic overpowers the listings. I hope that in the next update they lighten things up.",False,2017-07-21 14:50:45,
5,Turtletie,Only issues I have is with checking out,"The app is great, very useful to buy cool used items for low prices.

I would like you add a option from what region specifically. Like there is ""Near Me"" ""Worldwide"" so maybe add something like ""United Kingdom"" or ""United State"".

I had to file a claim with PayPal to get my money back & it's been 2 months and PayPal has yet to refund my money to me. Despite many emails to their customer service, Depop never did anything to help me. To top it all off, this said seller retaliated against me by giving me a negative feedback filled with lies after I gave her a negative feedback.

The one downside is that you HAVE to have a PayPal. I get the reason behind having a PayPal is so that it's more secure, but when you don't have a PayPal or your PayPal gets hacked, then you can't buy or sell at all :\
Besides the PayPal only deal, the Depop is a really great app. I do really wish that Depop will find some other way of payment.",False,2017-08-25 01:02:36,
3,Littleladybug26,Kinda annoying to sell items on here,"I like this app but i strongly suggest they get a ""my wallet"" to put our money in then just transfer it that way to our banks, instead of using PayPal. PayPal is super annoying and to confusing to use. I also think they should include shipping and include a shipping label. It also makes it difficult to sell stuff on this app without shipping included and a shipping label. This is why I like Vinted WAY better! It makes it so much easier!!",False,2016-05-24 19:41:08,
1,Kseusss,New update,It's unfortunate because this used to be a pretty decent app. Now it is almost impossible to navigate and there is no flow to the design whatsoever. Everything looks zoomed in and it gives me a headache. What's worse is that they got rid of the activity page so you can't see what people buy and like (which was a really great way to see new items other than the crap on the explore page which is always the same stuff). With this update it makes me as a user feel secluded from the rest of depop. I don't even want to use this app anymore.,False,2017-07-27 17:19:43,

Advice: Nice to use to make an extra few bucks but don't expect to be bringing in hundreds right away. It just all depends. Some can sale well because of how their pics are taken, others sell well due to how cheap they charge, or one simply has items that people want. To conclude, a bad bad update.

So after I made a sale, Depop takes their commission before your payment from the buyer even makes its way to you. And they won't refund you their portion even if the buyer didn't end up paying you.

Are you here to buy stuff or not? If your just on here liking stuff go to Instagram or Facebook. Stop trying to make this a social network.  We're trying to sell our stuff not get likes.

1,Brynnnna,The worst resale app on the market,"I am a frequent user of resale apps for buying and selling, and I heard so much about depop so I thought I'd give it a chance. The WORST resale app out there.

2) no organization on the app, honestly if you want to find something it's impossible
3) no requirements for the sellers to ship within a reasonable time frame or to even respond to you.

4,Nicole tp,Prefer it over every other selling platform,"I've been selling vintage and unique clothing for years, but I've only recently started using Depop and I already prefer it over other sites that I have used and it is already more lucrative for me...both for selling and finding cool stuff to buy and connecting with other people with the same hobby. I think the people talking about how they never get sales fail to see that thousands of people use this app and if you post something a month ago it's going to get lost in the search results - you have to consistently update your shop/listings and stay active, which is what you should be doing if you're looking to get paid in any way, depop or not!! Or y'all have nothing unique to offer . My items have been selected for feature several times! I find on other sites it's overly cluttered and you get discouraged looking through but on this app it's clean and minimal and to the point, and it's also easy to keep up with other people's stuff because it's just like an Instagram feed and friends list. I like the simplicity but the only thing I would change is to be able to have the ability to change the order of which things appear in your shop ! That's the only reason I've rated 4/5 because I'm just hoping someone's looking at the reviews for feedback and considers it. Me and many other people have tons of stuff in our shop, it's like a little business and want it to be really organized and having to manually edit everything in a specific order is very time consuming and mad annoying. Other than that, keep up the great work y'all xo",False,2017-01-10 18:51:29,

3,lvmberjackie,Needs more than PayPal,"Depop is fantastic for putting items up for sale and meeting a widespread amount of people. However, if you don't connect your profile to PayPal, there is no way to buy instantly and users must message you first to coordinate it with you. It would be much better to have instant payment available for other cash apps like Square cash and Venmo. I've had several problems with PayPal while using depop and I am not even going to use PayPal at all after they finally get back to me about an issue I've been contacting them about for an entire month.
Depop would also be greatly improved if they made an option on a post that allows you to post measurements. A lot of us post measurements in the description but a lot of times customers don't really read it there and ask for it in a message. 
Another great improvement would be to allow for photos that are longer in length. Working within a square for a photo is very limiting, like when taking full-body pics for longer items. If they were able to be longer in length, it would help make the post more attractive and that's really all that sellers are trying to do with their posts. 
Lastly I just think depop needs to find a way to filter out comments from the shop owner and only show the ones from other users. This way, when new people look at the post they can see if their question was already asked and they can click ""view more"" or something on the comments to see the shop owner's responses. Right now it just looks hella cluttered especially if the item has a long description, and for me that's a big turn off and I don't want new people to be deterred just because of the clutter. 
Hope this could be helpful! Please feel free to email me or contact me on depop if you have questions or anything. Thank you!",False,2017-01-11 17:32:43,

2,Wrongfully kicked off posh,I choose a different app,"I sell quite a lot, mostly on eBay, but I've gravitated towards apps because their easier to list on and sometimes, easier to use. I don't mind the fees-I'm used to charging more anyway because of ebay fees and they're honestly not as bad as other apps. As far as scamming goes, there's really nothing that depop can do, and I find it naive of buyers to think that if they trade their items or pay outside of the app and using paypals ""friends and family"" option that they are protected in anyway by depop or that they think it's depops responsibility to prevent scammers taking advantage of this. That's just dumb. I do feel like depop needs A LOT of work. First, there are no filters or categories. In order for people to find your items, you have to use hashtag spamming and just wait for people to search for your specific item. There's no way to browse different brands or sizes or types of clothing/accessories. There also no way to go back to items that you've ""liked,"" so either buy it now or good luck getting back to it later, with all the hashtag spams and lack of filters. What bothers me most as a seller is the fact that listings end up ""dying"" after a while. You have to relist the same things over and over in order to try and sell anything, which I'm not willing to do. Selling on depop is much like selling on instagram, it's a lot of work as a seller and completely unnecessary when there are so many other ways out there to sell. In addition to the filters, I also think a good idea would be to filter by country. I like that my market isn't limited to one country, but sometimes there's items I want that I'm not willing to pay international shipping for. It's also annoying as a seller to get requests for free international shipping for my already cheap items. All in all, I have plenty of items listed on this app and have only sold one, which is good enough for me to stay on the app-I might as well- but it's not keeping me active and if it wasn't for that one sale I probably would have deleted the app by now. I find myself turning down trades and lowballs more often than being productive.",False,2014-09-26 18:56:05,

5,jessiebarber,Best selling app!,"I love Depop! It's easy and I have made good money selling items from my closet and home that I don't wear or use.

I was reading through the reviews and noticed a lot of people complaining about fees. Depop takes 10% of your sales, which is far below what Poshmark, Threadflip, etsy and eBay take. It's mind boggling that people are complaining about the amount of commission this app takes — they have employees and developers to pay who created this app for you to make extra money. 😑 if you're pricing and shipping efficiently, you're making far more than you could reselling your clothes to resale shops like Buffalo, Plato's, etc. 

I love that the layout is similar to Instagram. I wish, however, there was an option to push all 'sold' items to the bottom of my feed. Or maybe a way to automatically make a bundle for someone instead of needing to make a new listing!

The major complaint are the pre-teens and lowballers. I sell low, middle, and high priced items (all with free shipping), and it's inevitable that someone will complain about prices or want to take the transaction off of Depop or ask ""Swap???"". I just ignore these people. I sell a lot of vintage cameras and all these dumb kids ask ""does it work?"" ... Even though it's a camera that hasn't had film made for it in 30+ years. Kids, you have a world of information at your fingertips. Use it. 

Keep up the great work, Depop! Hopefully we can see new features to keep children off the app and organize our shops and sales. I love it thus far!",False,2015-12-07 19:41:34,

1,AKC916,Worst Selling App,"Depop offers no help to you as a seller or a buyer if something goes wrong. I was scammed out of nearly $100 due to a buyer opening a false chargeback claim after receiving the item she bought from me and giving me a 5 star rating and Depop would not even so much as remove the person from the app. Their customer service ignores any messages you send to them and only responds with automated replies that barely have anything to do with what you said in the first place. They remove your items for no reason if any random person reports it without investigating. I've had countless items removed for absolute BS reasons (using a stock photo when I was not using a stock photo, etc) and if I relist the item, I get a ""warning"" from Depop because again, they only offer automated emails. There is no contact phone number to talk to a person directly. They also will not investigate any report I make even when I provide them with details, screenshots, etc, and refuse to remove the one poor feedback somebody left me even though I provided them with more than enough proof to show that the person made up a story and slandered my name. Not to mention, I barely make any sales on the app. I had a few thousand followers and made maybe 1 sale a month. There are tons of ""bots"" on the app that comment and message you with fake spam email addresses asking you to email them about an item you're selling. The actual people that use the app are also pretty terrible. They overcharge for items they clearly bought at their local thrift store and act like you greatly offended them if you make a reasonable offer based on the brand, condition, etc of the item. The people are very catty and make ""name and shame"" posts about each other that never get taken down but my account was just removed for making a similar post about the person that actually did scam me.",False,2016-12-29 13:34:16,

1,TiVo3,(AVIOD) Better off with Poshmark or Mercari,"This app seems okay at first but it's not. There's a lot of glitches, it won't open at times, slow to load... or nothing wants to load, the list goes on. Customer service are not helpful at all. They will leave the same generic messages to you if you have a problem. An item was sold, and I had to upgrade my shipping label because I realized that the item was going to be heavier... so, I ended up paying the shipping cost and refunded the buyer because it was my fault. Because I didn't use the their shipping label, I can not rate the buyer and the buyer can't rate me. I've sent proof that it was delivered and everything and all I got was, ""we're aware of the issue and weren't trying to fix glitch"" this has been over three weeks. Also, the guidelines say ""no nudity"" but of course if you look around there's half naked pictures of people showing their butts or breasts (most are not easy on the eyes). I don't need to be looking around to buy something and then encounter these types of pictures which are prohibited on their app but they never take it down. If you encounter a bad (or the item you got was damaged dishonest) seller, good luck, depop can't help you, ONLY PayPal can, so every action will be going towards PayPal. Even when you report it to depop, again, you will get a similar message like, ""oh, no we're sorry you've experienced this and hopefully you will still like our community because we think it's great... unfortunately, we can't do anything and all refunds or issues will have to be reported to PayPal"". This is pretty annoying and it can take forever for the issue to be solved. I prefer Poshmark, better quality customer service and it's more safe, as in, they will and can help you directly with any issues. Mercari, has gotten better their customer service. Both of these apps will get back to you in a timely matter and with ""non-generic"" messages and it's easier to sell and they make it fair to everyone who is selling. I noticed that depop is very selective in the ""explore or new seller"" section, it's more geared towards hipsters, vintage, and ""their"" type of style, that's sad and unfair. Because if you don't really fall into that category it's harder to sell, unless it's dirt cheap compared to a vintage $40 shirt. Depop should be open to everyone and ALL types of styles instead of being closed-minded and only pick ""their"" types. Lastly, I've been waiting for at least two weeks for someone to get back to me because I would like my account to be closed. It shouldn't take this long, they need to get their stuff together, and be more professional. Now I know why a lot of people don't like using depop and why there's bad reviews.",False,2017-03-30 17:47:56,

3,Lilly:],Used to love!,"My friend introduced me to this app about one month ago, and I immediately loved it! I would clear out my closet and get excited to list, or search through the activity page to see what my friends have liked and sold. Whenever I reported a scammer I would get a response within the day, where as other customer service from other apps has taken months to hear back from. 
Their choice of what was featured on the popular page was always fun to look through to discover new fairly priced smaller accounts, and was a great way to base what to sell off of what was chosen. I had been featured 3 times and each time it boosted my business! I had sold 12 items in the first week and was instantly hooked!

Ever since they've updated the app and given it a makeover, I've been extremely discouraged to sell or buy as my sales have dropped from 2 a day, to 2 a week if I'm lucky. 
The algorithm for the featured page seems to be more automated based than chosen by hand like it used to be because I've seen the same 4 accounts up there with 2-5 items on the feature page, side by side at that. I'm no longer encouraged to look at it as it seems to be biased towards certain accounts. 

Last night I was searching for other resell apps to use for financial support on the side since I no longer make the sales I used to, and I came across the reviews for depop. I read many detailed reviews about people feeling the same and giving less stars, but it seems as if they are no longer available to read??

I as well as other users just don't feel like the update has been in the best interest of sales. My shop has suffered from 160% less sales as there's just much less activity on it then prior to the update. 

I'm sure this update was a project someone has been working on for a while and was extremely excited to roll out, and all of the negative worded reviews were upsetting. But the beauty of being human is that you can try something out, and if it doesn't work you always have that option of going back. If you don't try you'll never see what the results could've been. 

I just hope depop reverts back to it's true and tried look and feel. It was perfect in its own simplistic way.",False,2017-08-04 12:29:00,

1,Raya Alexandra,Honest experience with the decline; it's REAL bad hunnies;(,"This app has gotten way worse since the update😭 it crashes sooooo often, I hate having to go through my entire receipts thing to clear feedback I have been given (Bc it's such a drag), messages fail to send all the time (when I have great wifi and try to close/restart the app, it still fails to send and then you may exit the app and open it again to see the failed message has deleted so you must reword and retype it all over again FOR IT TO FAIL AGAIN😭dude), when I look something up it'll say ""2,397 results"" for example, and then I'll scroll through only to see AT MOST a good 200? If it says like ""157 results"" then no doubt only 30 (if that many) will show :// super bothersome !! Am I not seeing them all?? Are there not really that many?? I don't want to buy something if there's a possibility there are other variations maybe even cheaper !! 😩🆘‼️🆘‼️🆘‼️🆘‼️🆘‼️🆘 AAANNNDDDDDD HERES A BIG THING ⁉️⁉️⁉️ you guys gotta put up the prices of those items you put in the ""recommended"" portion Bc yeah, that item may be similar to the description of the one I'm lookin at, but I'm lookin at this one Bc I want it for the PRICE, if I find a recommended for cheaper that's GREAT  like HELLLOOO😻🤗🤗 but I am not about to look through every. single. recommended. (Like the full 20?) to see none of them are in my price range, what a bother hun :-/ also this don't matter too much but you guys already get quite a bit of money 😊 could u like 😊 lower ur depop fees😊 I mean that's not a version problem it's just you guys benefit from EVERY purchase ever made on this site (and there are some pretty pricey items!!🐸☕️) but we (well the majority) make our lil sales once in a while or have this app in order to sell Bc we dirt poor anyway :-) u guys got the money to make this app y'all got it kinda good ;( ask for donations idk I wanna buy a shirt but can't Bc they say too much will be taken out for depop fees like that's a shame y'all OH WELL just sayin for the RLLY LIL PPL anyway honestly there are so many more problems w this but I cannot express how annoying it is to see it crash every five seconds",False,2017-08-04 01:08:23,

1,Not recognizing,High Fees/ Scammers/ Bad Place to Sell/ Unreliable and many crashes and bugs!!,"The ""Depop Team"" takes two to three days to reply to you. One slight slip up in following all the terms of service and you get your account deleted and can't make one ever again and can never be part of the community again. Highly disappointed in the inability to have items featured on their explore (popular) page. They only choose to showcase items that'll make them the most money and are either from a new seller to get them excited about the app or a generic seller who already has a big shop. The 10% fee is ridiculous! Especially if you're using their shipping labels and your item is under and ounce, you're still paying WAY more than the actual shipping cost if you were to print a label through PayPal! Depop is cheating You of your money, trust, and time. I DO NOT EVER Recommend this app to anyone. NOT EVER. Even Poshmark with the higher selling fees is Way better than the whole of depop!!!! Thanks for reading and I hope I helped you in your decisions. I don't expect depop to make any improvements about my complaints as they would lose money on these changes. So I'll let them keep losing customers from their ""community."" Bye bye depop, or how about deadpoop....

FOR BUYING:
Buying is sketchy and there are a lot of scammers on the app. Even if they have 100 5 star reviews, they will still scam you-and depop will SUPPORT them! As long as they are making money, they make returns extremely challenging and aggravating for the buyers. They put money over their ""community"" all day everyday. Sellers never ship and depop never cares. Sellers make promises in their descriptions of items and none of them are NEVER accurate. The sellers don't care about you and your buying experience; they Only want your money!!! Depop, and their sellers, always always ALWAYS aren't there for you. HORRIBLE BUYING AND SELLING AND OVERALL APP EXPERIENCE. NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THIS APP OR EVER REFER IT TO ANYONE ELSE. Ever. . . .",False,2017-05-16 14:18:22,

1,Disappointed Depop,Depop is the worst selling app to ever exist,"Most of the buyers are terrible at communicating, try to scam you out of money and get confused over the tiniest things. People have made me add together prices because they didn't know what $8 + $6 was. This is only the beginning of the issues. Shipping is expensive for the seller, at least $6.45 for a package. But most of the buyers expect free shipping even on items that only cost them literally $1. The representatives for Depop are terrible at communicating. I messaged them with my complaint and they responded saying they didn't have time to respond to my message, which was clearly a lie because they could have spent the time they took to send that message to actually read my complaint and respond. The complaint was only two sentences, it's not like I sent them a novel. In addition to this, PayPal is holding my funds for the items I have already shipped out. I am told I have to add tracking info to be able to accept the order, but nowhere on any page does it give me that option. PayPal has a fun feature where if the payment isn't accepted within 30 days the buyer is refunded. But I have already shipped the items so the buyer would end up with both their money and the items they wanted if that were to happen. PayPal and Depop never messaged me saying my account was suspended or put on hold for any reason, so that should not be the case. The first item I ever sold on Depop the girl bought without paying shipping and refused to pay shipping so I refunded her money. But Depop and PayPal kept their commission and only refunded her the part that was mine. Since this occurrence, PayPal hasn't let me refund anything or access any Depop payments. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE, IT IS A TOTAL SCAM AND WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.",False,2016-12-07 22:50:08,

3,Bleeeegghhh,Just being honest.,"I've been selling on Depop for about 2 years now. There was a moment where I absolutely loved it. Other than minor technical difficulties, if you know what you're doing, it's a great and convenient app to sell on. The platform is super easy to use and it can help so much.
*update- NOT even the platform is good anymore. The new layout is not only ugly but inconvenient. Aside from that, there are many valid concerns
which I hope they no longer ignore.
Sellers are able to get what is called ""Staff Picked"" which enables your follows to go up dramatically, resulting in plenty of traffic and sales if you're working at it. 
But now, there couldn't possibly be enough new people joining the app for that to function. I think that to be fair, and to keep this app going strong, they need to come up with different ways to help new serious users make just as many sales(and followers) as anyone who joined when the app was booming would've. 
I also find it odd that they will leave either popular instagramers or famous people on the staff picks for months at a time(when they haven't made a sale in months) instead of giving a fair chance to people who are trying to establish a business and could potentially make Depop a lot of money. Another vital thing, as many have stated, is that it ought to have a method of age verification because there are a tremendous amount of under aged kids who steal their parents money to buy, or just flat out waste your time. 
I fear that the app will not function for too much longer due of the complete lack of customer service and total unprofessional decisions that the developer seems to be making. Ever since Edmo left, no one bothers to sustain or help a single user. It almost appears as if the developers don't care much since they're making 10% of every sale in fees. Maybe I'm wrong about that, but I just can't see where that money could be going by what I've observed about this company. 
Anyway, it would benefit the users, and the company as a whole if some foundational adjustments were made to keep this app appropriately fair and a great place to sell for anyone. Rather than being a popularity contest. It isn't IG.",False,2017-08-30 20:03:01,

2,"Disappointed, lack of features",App is buggy and inconvenient,"Depop is an ok selling platform but the app needs a lot of work. Here are some minor gripes that add up to a bad experience for me...
- When adding a listing you can only select one photo at a time, meaning you have to scroll back through your album each searching for each photo you want to add. This is slow and painful. Every other selling platform I use lets me select all my listing photos at once.
- Photos are square, which unless you took the photo specifically with depop in mind, means your photo will be cropped. There is currently no way to fit a non square picture to frame (without using a separate app) so chances are your photo will just look bad. The app offers really overdone filters, but no rotation.
- The listing categories are a mess, lacking, and confusing. Items have to be listed as either menswear or womenswear (no unisex) so you are cutting off half your customer base for those browsing by category.
- Some people (now i have this problem as well) have an issue where notifications of sold items never go away, uninstalling and wiping data doesn't help.
- Additionally customer service is extremely slow and sometimes nonresponsive. This isn't a problem  with the app, the company is probably just understaffed.

There are other issues as well which is a shame as if listing items wasn't such a chore on here i would add more of my inventory, but instead will continue mostly using other selling platforms, and list only things that I can't sell on other services on depop.",False,2017-05-17 18:50:38,

1,vjv100,"Great Clothes, But Know The Risks.","I love the clothes on DePop. I really wish I could love this app and give it 5 stars, because I love what it stands for, the interface, and the people on it. 

However, I'm giving it one star because I found DePop to be unreliable in a way that puts my money, clothes, and rapport with other users on the line with almost no communication from customer support. 

After about 2 weeks on the app, my account got shut down with no warning, email, or notification. Suddenly, I couldn't contact anyone about purchases and sales. I couldn't know if I would receive items I bought, or if buyers would retract their payments after they saw me disappearing once making a sale. 

I emailed customer service right away and got no response. I sent another email with no response. After going on a limb and Facebook messaging DePop, I finally got someone who responded - they were going to reactivate me. Apparently, there had been a ""glitch"" that shut down my account. 

I can't trust an app that could glitch and put my purchases, sales, money, and items in limbo. Nor can I be confident in a company that does not respond to emails asking why I was suspended. I received a quick email response when asking advice on how to answer a scammer, but when I needed a time sensitive response about my account disappearing, I got nothing. I'm lucky I decided to try Facebook, or I wouldn't be able to finish transactions.

There are other minor problems that show inconsistencies in DePop's interactions with users, but this was one that put my money in limbo. It's hard for me to look past this!! I hope they are better about getting back to emails and preventing ""glitch"" deletions of accounts.

I want to stress that the items, app design, user friendliness, and buying processes are all very nice. But please, know the risks!",False,2017-05-26 20:22:21,

I have gotten seller fee refunds in the past for this reason, however they take so long and sometimes you have to email them three times to even get in reply back. I am currently waiting on these people for a refund. It’s been a week now and still nothing. I’m missing $20 from my PayPal. I got emails from two different people saying hey refunded me...why wasn’t I refunded the first time?? Very very sketchy. Not cool. Also the app is glitchy at times.

1. you tap on a members profile, attempt to view a members item and it whites out, you then attempt tap or swipe back and the item whites out unable to view the photos.

2. On your shop when you tap the 3 dots in the top right corner its unresponsive. Meaning you cannot mark an item as sold, share etc.

3. Occasionally when you want to ""save""  or ""like"" an item its unresponsive. Also, there are times when you cannot access a members profile.

I have deleted the app, cleared cache, redownloaded the app it's the same ole song.

I earlier made the mistake of posting a custom piece that had a luxury brand printed on it (I explained it was fake in the caption many times), and I was still flagged for trying to sell counterfeit.

Also I forgot to mention, I never get featured on the explore page anymore when I used to this summer before all of that happened. Anyways, I am very frustrated because I have been working extremely hard to continually post quality items and I still have over 100 five star reviews and yet it seems as if all of my hard work is not paying off anymore :(. I used to love Depop because I really enjoyed selling my thrift finds and receiving great reviews by providing quality service to my customers. It also used to cover far more than my rent per month so it was a great source of income for me.

1,Danny,Beware of Scammers,"Had a seller tell me he was selling “Authentic jordan 1s”, got them in the mail and they were fakes. Depop allows sellers to create their own rules such as no returns no refunds, etc. Beware because a lot of people on this app sell fake items, but claim that they are authentic. Stick to Goat, stock x or other apps to buy things from! 
Funny thing is, the guy who sold me the fake Jordan 1s gathered over 60 sales on his profile in a matter of weeks when I had first seen his profile he was at 20 sales! Let’s say he’s selling each pair of shoes for $150( at the minimum, most shoes can go for up to $300), he just made $9,000! Pretty awesome for the scammers, but beware buyers! By the time my shoes were shipped, the buyer emailed me to let me know he had to “delete his depop account due to problem with the app”. Sounds like he creates these random accounts, sells a ton of shoes, erases the account so he can’t be tracked, then most likely continues his hustle! This users name was @julio01 (good luck finding him now, as there is no trace of him to be found), and he also messaged me off a sketch email.

They just want money and it’s very clear from the email promotions as well as the percentage they take from sales. Now 10% may not seem like a lot when something is $10, however when it becomes $100 and you lose $10 it’s a little bit more of a dent. Not to mention PayPal tales fees from the WHOLE amount you make, not after the fee depop takes. In actuality you’re losing about 14% of your sales. Making money during this time of uncertainty is hard to come by. The sellers on here are nice, but the customer service blows. 

You have a better chance of making money on selling through Instagram or literally anything that isn’t depop. The help center should be called “company coverage” because all they do is cover the company’s butt for whatever these idiots are doing that they can blame you for.

4,siennaaa :),◻️great app with great potential!◾️,"◾️◻️i downloaded depop in the beginning of the summer for no reason other than summer boredom. after scrolling through the app for a while, i recognized that it was a pretty great app. depop is a large online marketplace where you can buy or sell clothes, accessories, pretty much anything. it's set up a bit like instagram, but with more selling and buying (obviously). i am both a depop seller and buyer. i recently started my own shop and i'm about to post my first few items! the reason i'm giving this app four stars is because it has one small flaw that i think could definitely be improved upon. depop makes it fairly difficult to find other sellers and get your own shop discovered. the algorithm should definitely have a way to suggest shops to you. instagram has a feature where you follow an account and it shows accounts that are similar to the one you just followed. if depop had something like this, sellers could get discovered more easily! just a thought. and oh, while i'm here: here's my depop! @stuckonaname thanks for reading, now go download depop!◻️◾️",False,2020-07-25 17:47:51,"{'id': 16938650, 'body': ""Hey.
