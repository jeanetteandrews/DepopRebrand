3,Hopeful üíñ,Love this app but hate the update,"I love shopping on depop. This is from a shopper‚Äôs perspective, not a buyers. The worst I‚Äôve ever experienced is sellers either not shipping or not being good at communicating and I tried reaching out to depop about it but ultimately I just let it go because it is what it is. But other than that, I still shopped on depop more cautiously, but now the app is way less appealing to me because the new layout is, there‚Äôs two rows of whatever you‚Äôre searching for which means more scrolling and more time spent on me trying to find what I want. And I know it‚Äôs probably not a huge deal to most especially with issues I was talking about earlier but I just hate it so much. I really prefer the layout of how it was before.",False,2020-10-01 21:32:20,"{'id': 18385960, 'body': ""Hey there,\n\nThanks for the feedback.

Easy to list and item hard to sell due to depops ‚Äúexplore‚Äù page only showcases ‚Äúaesthetically pleasing‚Äù photos- photos from their verified people even if the item is sold already it will stay up for days.

1,Miss Grisius,Sellers are dishonest and disappointing,"This app is the least professional of any of the online selling apps. I‚Äôve used Poshmark and Mercari with very few issues. All of the sellers I have come into contact with on Depop have sent me items that qualified for a dispute, but I didn‚Äôt want to deal with it. The items did not match the description, photos have all been purposefully deceitful. Sellers should not stay on your app or be able to get by with five stars when they ship out damaged merchandise for a pretty penny. I don‚Äôt love the layout or shipping options that sellers have. I feel like shipping has been exorbitantly expensive. I sell online too. I get it. It‚Äôs why I use these apps and don‚Äôt appreciate being treated like this as a customer.

1,~yogabbygabby~,Terrible Customer Service,"Depop offers NO seller / buyer protection, handles all transactions with a 3rd party, and has a huge scam problem. I have used nearly every clothing selling app there is & Depop is by far the worst. They use PayPal for all transactions - so not only will you be charged 10% of your sale by Depop fees, but you will also be charged with PayPal fees. Poshmark, Mercari and Vinted are all far more worth your time to sell or buy clothes. I highly recommend Poshmark if you want to be charged with less fees, receive seller protection and have acceptable customer service. 

There are far better clothing selling platforms that do NOT make you face more fees by going through PayPal as a third party. Not sure why Depop can‚Äôt handle $ on their own without using PayPal as a third party? It means more money for them and less for users.",True,2020-03-02 14:29:25,"{'id': 13803045, 'body': ""Hey.

3,Yubipop,Prefer old Depop,"The new update isn't that great, the red is pretty obnoxious and not pleasant to look at. When refreshing my own shop, it gets pretty annoying since only half the screen can be pulled down to refresh (so it's really awkward to refresh when I get such a small space to swipe down). Most of the time, a lot of the buttons and part of the text will glitch out and I won't be able t see it and it's really hard to click. I really enjoyed the old setup where I could see what other people liked and not have my notifications at the top. For the looks, I prefer the green buy button from before as this one doesn't really have a nice font choice. The letters are ultra bold and look flattened, the contrasting colors are also distracting. Really not a fan of the font, doesn't look very neat.  The bottom buttons look a little off and aren't as nice to click (sometimes it doesnt feel like you clicked them but you did or the other way around). Even though Im not a fan of the color, I dislike the font choice even more because it looks like the fonts from high school presentations that were thrown together.

1,student22347,"Glitch, Scammers, and will not issue a refund","Depop seemed amazing at first, but the first time I purchased something on the app (this entire transaction was completed in-app), there was a glitch and the seller did not receive the prepaid shipping label and the purchase did not show up on my profile. Therefore, the seller had to pay for shipping a second time at the post office and we could not leave feedback for each other. I contacted Depop so the seller could receive a refund but it was so complicated and she decided that she did not want to go through the trouble. I then asked Depop for a refund of the money I paid for shipping which did not end up being used for shipping due to the glitch. Depop is telling me to contact the seller to initiate the refund but I do not want her to go through further trouble for me. Besides, it has been over two weeks since I made the purchase and originally contacted Depop. I am severely disappointed at the way Depop has been handling the glitch, making it so complicated to receive a refund, and replying to my emails so late that this problem has been dragged out for so long.
